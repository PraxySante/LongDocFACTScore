1109.4038,"using the hz prescription, which determines the length of the radiation and matter periods of an arbitrary cosmological model, we obtain a formula for the matter and radiation power spectrum of generic dark energy models. using the derived formulae,    we calculate the matter power spectrum of such models. unlike standard   methods , the present approach avoids solving in full the perturbation equations for the radiation and matter components. therefore, it is trivial to construct the matter power spectrum for any model. it is even more useful to obtain an approximate, but comparable, power spectrum for an arbitrary model. we demonstrate the power spectrum analytically for the nonrelativistic evolution and growth factor of subhorizon density perturbations in the fiducial @xmath0cdm model under consideration. it is found that the present matter power spectrum is in general not quite affected by the evolution in the subhorizon of density perturbations. the difference in the matter and radiation power spectra can be used as a measure of how accurately dark energy evolves in a universe.","we present a detailed analysis of the cosmic expansion history in the concordance @xmath0cdm cosmology . we find that the current accelerated phase of expansion is driven by a cosmological constant @xmath0 that dominates the present energy density of the universe , whose equation of state ( eos ) parameter is @xmath1 . the second component in importance is cold dark matter ( dm ) , a non - baryonic dust component that drives the growth of large scale structure ( lss ) . this simple model fits rather well the observational data and requires the minimum set of cosmological parameters  we show how to compute the matter power spectrum of de cosmological models using a fiducial @xmath0cdm model and the growth factor of subhorizon density perturbations of the model under consideration . this allows to use data on cmb temperature anisotropies and galaxy clustering to discriminate models without having to solve the evolution of density perturbations of all matter components , thus economizing much effort . in most cosmological models ,the equations describing the time evolution of matter density perturbations can be derived from the conservation of the energy momentum tensor and solved for each component individually . ","introduction:    several observables that can be computed in terms of the matter power spectrum alone are derived, with no need of solving in full the matter power spectrum and no restrictions on the cosmic expansion rate or on the cosmic microwave background( cmb ) temperature anisotropies.  moreover, the matter power spectrum also remains largely free from the coincidence problem.

 methods:    we present an analytical method of computing the matter power spectrum of models with no cosmological constant ( cosmological constant, eos ) from cosmological matter power spectra.  the matter power spectrum of a given non - de model, even if its cosmological parameters are the same in the @xmath0cdm universe, will differ noticeably from the power spectrum of a model with no cosmological constant.  we show that this difference arises because it is not the evolution of an arbitrary eos parameter, and that the scale of matter radiation equality is shifted to larger scales.  the matter density perturbations are also shifted to larger scales and slows down once the overall expansion accelerates.  we also show that this simple treatment of the equation of state could lead to a better understanding of the cosmological history and dark energy.  we further discuss the efficiency of the algorithm to solve non - de models with constant eos and use it to compare the dark energy growth rate with that of models with no cosmological constant.

"," introduction:    the aim of this paper is to study the time delay between the simultaneous recorded electroencephalogram and electromyogram data of subjects with essential tremor.  first, we apply a spectral method, maximising coherence for the time delay.  in both cases, the results obtained are in good agreement within a narrow range of the delay used in the simulation.  then, we apply this method to simultaneously recorded traces of electroencephalogram ( eeg ) and electromyogram of subjects with essential tremor a well known pathological form of hand tremor.  we obtain a delay of 11 - 27 milli seconds ( @xmath0 ) between the eeg and emg data, making the estimated time delay consistent with previous experimental result of cortico - muscular transmission.  we further find that the coherence in the interval between the eeg and emg data increases with the non - linearity of the correlation between the cortical activity and the network activity.  this implies a significant effect of cortex in the generation of essential tremor. we conclude that the proposed spectral method is useful for time delay estimation and the ability to estimate the coherence between the eeg and emg signals can be used

 methods:    a method of estimating time delay from narrow band coherent signals is suggested.  the method is shown to allow the estimation of coherence and phase from narrow band coherent signals.  the method is also applied to physiological data.

 methods:    using a method of self - consistent boundary layer ( scp ) approximation and a paramagnetic renormalization group for valence electrons, we study quasiparticle dispersion as a function of the rashba type spin - orbit coupling strength.  in particular, we study the phase diagram as a function of a magnetic field strength for the junction and its spin dependence on a chemical potential.  it is observed that at half - filling a large phase of the superconductor, the quasiparticle - valence electrons undergo a spin - orbit phase transition, whereas above this phase the wave function of the valence electrons undergo spin - orbit phase transition.  the critical current in the valence electrons is increased by the spin - orbit interaction in a small fraction.

 results:    the experimental results show that such anomaly occurs in an arbitrary number of parameters for the tunnel junction.
