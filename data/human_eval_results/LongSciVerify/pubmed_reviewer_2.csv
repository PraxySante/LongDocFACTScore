 methods:    radiation dose and image noise are less than those reported for conventional conventional ccta and stress echocardiography. 

 results: from the literature indicate that , but not from other studies , high - resolution echocardiography is more useful for evaluation of suspected cad than simple clinical evaluation . stress echocardiography is also commonly performed on patients with myocardial involvement . the diagnosis of cad has not been confirmed in the published literature , but many studies have suggested that stress echocardiography is superior to stress perfusion imaging for evaluation of high risk ( left main disease and/or triple vessel ) disease because of the greater risk of missing severe cad with perfusion imaging . when assessed using electrocardiographic stenting , elevated blood flow in the right ventricle is associated with the occurrence of hypertrophy and increased risk of congestive heart failure . 

 conclusion: as the pre - test probability of cad increases above 20 % in symptomatic patients , ccta provides a cost - effective initial evaluation , and we predict that ccta might be an important diagnostic tool in high - risk symptomatic patients . increased cad risk in these patients has implications for early and specific cardiovascular management .",3,2,1,3,1,2,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,0
PMC3388353,"phosphoregulation plays a role in the evolution of protein residues in a condition - specific fashion. in yeast s. cerevisiae, paralogous proteins have shown a tendency to evolve from nonphosphorylated ser and thr in a constitutive fashion. however, the ancestral role of the phosphorylated amino acid, named a phosphorylatable ser ( pser ), in yeast primate paralogs remains unresolved. we have investigated the evolutionary fate of the paralogs of the yeast primate s. cerevisiae, using the yeast phosphoproteome as a model system to infer the evolutionary fate of two closely related phosphosites in the saccharomyces cerevisiae genome. we found that the majority of the paralogs are located in one paralog but most of them are still in the other in this form of paralog. the divergence of paralogous proteins via the different amino acids is consistent in the yeast pser and pthr. the phosphosites evolve more often from negatively charged amino acids in paralogous proteins compared to their nonphosphorylated counterparts. the replacement of an asp or a glu residue may block one paralog into a constitutive functional","gene duplication is one of the most prominent mechanisms by which organisms acquire new functions . spectacular examples of such gains of function resulting from gene duplications are the evolution of trichromatic vision in primates , the evolution of human beta - globin genes that are involved in the oxygen transport at different developmental stages as well as the expansion of the family of immunoglobulins and other immunity - related genes that shaped the vertebrate immune system . because of the central role of gene duplication in evolution , there has been a profound interest for a better understanding of how these new functions evolve at the molecular level , for determining at what rate gene duplication occurs we assembled a data set that consists of 2,726 phosphosites ( ser , 82% ; thr , 16% ; tyr , 2% ) that belong to one or the other member of the 352 pairs of yeast wgd paralogs for which at least one of the two proteins is a phosphoprotein . we inferred the ancestral sequence for each pair of paralogs using alignments with orthologous sequences from l. kluyveri and z. rouxii , two species that diverged from s. cerevisiae before the wgd event . for each pair , we tested this hypothesis on the complete set of wgd phosphoproteins of budding yeast s. cerevisiae . using two different methods to infer the ancestral state of phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated ser and thr , we found that pser and pthr globally have a tendency to evolve from negatively charged amino acids in paralogous phosphoproteins compared to their nonphosphorylated counterparts . however , the observed differences are not significant , which could be explained by a few nonexclusive scenarios .","introduction:    the aim of this study was to determine whether a phosphate - rich phosphonates - dependent change occurs after a gene duplication event ( wgd ) or a partial loss in a duplication event ( pfm ).  genes that have been fused at several time points in multiple time points were selected by the pfm and then sequenced by polymerase chain reaction ( pccr ). 

 methods:    phylogenetic methods for analysis of phosphosites in wgd sequences and for characterizing specific species of the protein are currently limited.  an alternative method that allows for an earlier analysis of pons of different species has also become widely applied, as the latter can not be used in sequence comparisons.  although it does not require a whole - genome duplication in the whole - genome sequence, it allows the analysis of pons of different members with different positions, and the comparison between the ancestral sequence and the orthologs suggests a high frequency of this interaction.  this approach is being used to interpret the sequence analysis, and its advantages include lower false discovery rates, higher reproducibility, and rapid phylogenetic identification.
