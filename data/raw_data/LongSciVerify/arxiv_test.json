high dispersive interaction in order to have a @xmath35-phase shift .", "the situation is instead different in the case of ions trapped in harmonic traps . in this case in fact , the free oscillation frequency @xmath30 , and therefore the cutoff frequency @xmath42 too , are usually much smaller and it becomes feasible to realize fast and frequent @xmath35-phase shifts .", "let us consider for

transitions involving the ions motion ( as it has been already done in @xcite where the deterministic entanglement of the internal states of two ions has been achieved by manipulating the stretching mode ) , suppressing decoherence of the center - of - mass motion is still important because the heating of the center - of - mass motion partially couples also with the other vibrational stretching modes @xcite .", "the parity kicks method could be used even in the case in which the center - of - mass mode itself is used as quantum bus for the realization of quantum gates .", "however in this

seeing in the intermediate stacked images should be measured empirically as before . then _ mscstack _ or the equivalent can be used to stack these intermediate images just as if they were individual images , scaling by the new _ mscscale _ values and calculating a new weights file using the above equations .", "as long as the final seeing is estimated well , no loss of signal - to - noise should occur from the iteration .", "a corollary question is when to discard an image with poor @xmath184 rather than to include it in the stack .", "the formal answer appears to be never as @xmath200 for all @xmath92 .", "the magic of the optimal weighting formula can be seen : @xmath201 hence the optimal weights cause @xmath184 to add in quadrature so it will never formally decrease no matter how poor an input image is .", "note that having a magnitude of extinction or twice the seeing still leaves an image with significant @xmath184 ; a @xmath184 threshold of 40% would require discarding

40% of that @xmath184 is 8% higher than that of the better image alone so this is somewhat useful .", "a conservative approach would be to cut entirely any images with @xmath202% that of the median image as a way of reducing systematic effects not accounted for by these idealized formulae .", "@xcite showed using simulations that the best performance for point source detection was achieved by filtering the image with the psf itself .", "this result is derived in the sextractor manual using fourier transforms . in practice due to the constraints of computation time one", "chooses to cut off

objects thus leads to a filter of the precise shape of the psf . for objects significantly brighter than the sky , @xmath207 giving constant weight i.e. a tophat which gradually morphs into the roughly gaussian shape of the psf as you move far enough away from the object center for the sky to dominate the noise .", "sextractor only allows for a fixed convolution kernel so we optimized the detection for sky - dominated objects by using the psf ( truncated to 7@xmath487 pixels ) as our filter . by the same argument", ", the optimum signal - to - noise measurement of the photometry of a point source will be obtained by a weighted sum of pixel fluxes weighted using the psf shape itself centered at the barycenter of the object .", "this is typically referred to as `` psf photometry '' but it is not a supported feature of sextractor photometry , just of object detection .", "note that this is no longer strictly optimal when the noise is correlated between pixels as we have found in our images , since the derivation of the optimal weights for each pixel assumed uncorrelated noise .", "we decided against using psf photometry for this reason , and also because many of our science objects are slightly resolved and this would overweight the fluxes in their core , increase the risk of color biases , and complicate the task of correcting the aperture fluxes of extended objects .",
