inflammatory activities : an initial pro - inflammatory action   was reported , with synoviocyte stimulation for mmp and cytokine release , followed by a limitation of the inflammatory response by decreasing inflammatory molecules and preventing chemotaxis of monocytes - like cells [ 44 , 75 ] .", "an overall down - modulation of the joint inflammation can explain the well - documented pain reduction , which is the most prominent and disabling symptom of cartilage lesions and knee oa .", "however , some findings suggest another intriguing aspect of prp action mechanism , with a direct analgesic effect : lee et al .   showed the role of prp in the augmentation of cannabinoid receptors cb1 and cb2 , which might be involved in the analgesic effects .", "further studies need to focus on understanding and possibly optimizing the analgesic and anti - inflammatory effects of prp .", "prp might not lead to hyaline cartilage regeneration and might not change the clinical history with significant disease - modifying properties , but it still might offer a clinical benefit with symptoms and function improvement and possibly a slowdown of the degenerative processes . the central feature in oa cartilage degeneration", "is the so - called apoptosis ( programmed cell death ) ; thus , chondrocytes apoptosis is a potential therapeutic target for oa interventions .", "the exact mechanism behind the prp regulation of the apoptotic pathway is unclear , but it is likely that prp might have an overall effect in slowing down the apoptosis cascade . among the hypothesized mechanisms , recent findings identified igf-1 protein as a possible effector of apoptosis inhibition : yin et al", ".   found that igf-1 may down - regulate the expression of programmed cell death 5 ( pdcd5 ) , thus inhibiting the apoptosis of osteoarthritic chondrocytes .", "interestingly , mifune et al .   observed an increased cell apoptosis in the in vitro setting , which , however , was not confirmed by the subsequent in vivo experiment , where lower levels of apoptosis were detected .", "thus , the authors suggested that it was the complex interaction of prp with the different joint structures ( synovium , fat pad , bone marrow ,  ) , which might positively influence chondrocytes apoptosis .", "the controversial findings reported underline the limits of preclinical studies , which do not exactly represent the peculiar human pathophysiology .", "nonetheless , although such experimental settings do not replace the fundamental role of robust clinical trials , in vitro studies can suggest mechanisms of action and directions for improvement and might explain some controversial findings in the reports of prp application in humans . as for other tissues , in vitro studies have shown the importance of the dosage of the potent platelet - derived growth factors , with different platelet concentrations leading to different results .", "activation might also play an important role , as well as the appropriate cell population which is also a key aspect for obtaining optimal results . with regard to this , leukocytes are a controversial prp component , since some authors attribute better results to leukocyte depletion , because of the supposed deleterious effects of proteases and reactive oxygen species released from white cells , whereas other authors consider them as a source of cytokines and enzymes that may also be important for the prevention of infections .", "several other variables have to be considered , such as the preparation methods and the consequent presence of other cells , storage modalities , application protocols , and many other aspects that might not be of secondary importance for determining prp properties and clinical efficacy .", "the number of names and acronyms encountered searching for studies on this biological treatment approach , such as prp , prgf , acp , pl , clearly represents the complexity of this field and explains the difficulties in literature analysis , study comparison , and understanding some contradictory results . with the limits of a complex field still in its infancy , few studies and some controversial results , this systematic review still showed some important aspects .", "the first one is that the increasing interest in this topic is being translated into research with a growing number of papers published over time , which show promise in shedding some more light on prp use in the near future .", "the second one is that , besides the limits and sometimes controversial findings of in vitro and animal studies , the preclinical literature documented an overall support toward prp application for the injective treatment of cartilage lesions and oa .", "moreover , some conclusions can be drawn also with regard to human application , which can be of clinical usefulness .", "the first one is the safety of prp injections , with no major adverse events reported in the literature and only some reports of self -

possibility to deliver a high concentration of autologous growth factors and bioactive molecules in physiologic proportions , with low costs and in a minimally invasive way .", "this explains the wide application of this blood derivative to several tissues and heterogeneous pathologies in different fields of medicine .", "the rationale for using platelets for the treatment of different tissues is that they constitute a reservoir of growth factors that are critical to regulate the tissue healing process , which is quite similar in all kinds of tissues .", "however , whereas the rationale for prp use in other tissues is clear , since platelets represent the first response to a tissue damage where they participate in stopping the vessel bleeding and trigger the healing cascade , less intuitive is the rationale for prp use in cartilage , which is a physiologically vessel - free tissue .", "moreover , whereas some molecules such as tgf -  might justify its use in cartilage , prp also contains other molecules such as vegf that do not take part or might even jeopardize cartilage homeostasis and regeneration [ 48 , 72 ] .", "thus , it is mandatory to investigate whether the overall effect of prp is also beneficial for the peculiar requirements of cartilage tissue before an indiscriminate human application .", "the systematic analysis of in vitro studies published up to now shows an overall positive effect of prp on cartilage tissue . besides some controversial results , most of the findings supported the role of prp in increasing chondrocyte proliferation , without affecting chondrogenic phenotype and with an increase in the production of matrix molecules .", "these properties of prp have provided positive results also in the animal model : preclinical studies confirmed the usefulness of prp treatment in different pathology models , with good results in cartilage regeneration after acute focal lesions , as well as in the more complex environment of joint osteoarthritic degeneration , and even in the challenging ra setting .", "nonetheless , both the rapid clinical benefit and the limited effect over time are in contrast with the timing required by a hypothetically induced cartilage regeneration process . despite the wide majority of studies focusing on cartilage tissue", ", it is actually likely that the clinical benefit reported after prp injection is attributable to other action mechanisms .", "an intra - articular injection does not just target cartilage , instead prp might influence the entire joint environment , and some in vitro studies confirm the effects of prp on other cell sources .", "synoviocytes are affected by platelet releasate , as well as meniscal cells and also mscs that seem to be induced by prp and act synergically toward tissue healing .", "the chemo - attractant activity of prp may contribute to the recruitment of other cells that might migrate into the damaged tissues , thus triggering the healing response [ 42 , 53 ] .", "prp has several potential effects by enhancing the cell signalling cascade in all joint tissues and inducing positive changes in the whole joint environment through a milieu of actions . among these", ", tissue regeneration is actually not the only and maybe not the most important prp mechanism of action , and increasing evidence supports the complex role of prp in modulating inflammation .", "prp showed both pro- and anti - inflammatory activities : an initial pro - inflammatory action   was reported , with synoviocyte stimulation for mmp and cytokine release , followed by a limitation of the inflammatory response by decreasing inflammatory molecules and preventing chemotaxis of monocytes - like cells [ 44 , 75 ] .", "an overall down - modulation of the joint inflammation can explain the well - documented pain reduction , which is the most prominent and disabling symptom of cartilage lesions and knee oa .", "however , some findings suggest another intriguing aspect of prp action mechanism , with a direct analgesic effect : lee et al .   showed the role of prp in the augmentation of cannabinoid receptors cb1 and cb2 , which might be involved in the analgesic effects .", "further studies need to focus on understanding and possibly optimizing the analgesic and anti - inflammatory effects of prp .", "prp might not lead to hyaline cartilage regeneration and might not change the clinical history with significant disease - modifying properties , but it still might offer a clinical benefit with symptoms and function improvement and possibly a slowdown of the degenerative processes . the central feature in oa cartilage degeneration", "is the so - called apoptosis ( programmed cell death ) ; thus , chondrocytes apoptosis is a potential therapeutic target for oa interventions .", "the exact mechanism behind the prp regulation of the apoptotic pathway is unclear , but it is likely that prp might have an overall effect in slowing down the apoptosis cascade . among the hypothesized mechanisms , recent findings identified igf-1 protein as a possible effector of apoptosis inhibition : yin et al", ".   found that igf-1 may down - regulate the expression of programmed cell death 5 ( pdcd5 ) , thus inhibiting the apoptosis of osteoarthritic chondrocytes .", "interestingly , mifune et al .   observed an increased cell apoptosis in the in vitro setting , which , however , was not confirmed by the subsequent in vivo experiment , where lower levels of apoptosis were detected .", "thus , the authors suggested that it was the complex interaction of prp with the different joint structures ( synovium , fat pad , bone marrow ,  ) , which might positively influence chondrocytes apoptosis .", "the controversial findings reported underline the limits of preclinical studies , which do not exactly represent the peculiar human pathophysiology .", "nonetheless , although such experimental settings do not replace the fundamental role of robust clinical trials , in vitro studies can suggest mechanisms of action and directions for improvement and might explain some controversial findings in the reports of prp application in humans . as for other tissues , in vitro studies have shown the importance of the dosage of the potent platelet - derived growth factors , with different platelet concentrations leading to different results .", "activation might also play an important role , as well as the appropriate cell population which is also a key aspect for obtaining optimal results . with regard to this , leukocytes are a controversial prp component , since some authors attribute better results to leukocyte depletion , because of the supposed deleterious effects of proteases and reactive oxygen species released from white cells , whereas other authors consider them as a source of cytokines and enzymes that may also be important for the prevention of infections .", "several other variables have to be considered , such as the preparation methods and the consequent presence of other cells , storage modalities , application protocols , and many other aspects that might not be of secondary importance for determining prp properties and clinical efficacy .", "the number of names and acronyms encountered searching for studies on this biological treatment approach , such as prp , prgf , acp , pl , clearly represents the complexity of this field and explains the difficulties in literature analysis , study comparison , and understanding some contradictory results . with the limits of a complex field still in its infancy , few studies and some controversial results , this systematic review still showed some important aspects .", "the first one is that the increasing interest in this topic is being translated into research with a growing number of papers published over time , which show promise in shedding some more light on prp use in the near future .", "the second one is that , besides the limits and sometimes controversial findings of in vitro and animal studies , the preclinical literature documented an overall support toward prp application for the injective treatment of cartilage lesions and oa .", "moreover , some conclusions can be drawn also with regard to human application , which can be of clinical usefulness .", "the first one is the safety of prp injections , with no major adverse events reported in the literature and only some reports of self - limiting immediate pain and swelling reaction [ 17 , 36 , 41 ] .", "the second one is that all studies seem to agree on an overall clinical benefit of prp .", "better results with respect to saline have been shown , and some studies suggest a slight superiority of prp with respect to visco supplementation [ 8 , 14 , 58 , 64 ] . however , not all patient categories present the same results that are more significant in younger patients affected by not too advanced degeneration , and the clinical benefit is limited over time and can roughly be estimated at less than 1  year .", "this might suggest that this treatment could be applied in cycles to ensure longer lasting results and postpone more invasive procedures .", "finally , another aspect emerges from the literature analysis : whereas among the available techniques none clearly seemed to offer superior clinical results , it appears clear that there is room for a better targeting of this prp application .", "several aspects still need to be studied to understand the mechanism of action of prp and give better treatment indications and

safeguard an adequate relationship , and we could contribute in increasing the autonomy of patient 's mature and responsible choices , without leaving him / her alone .", "thirdly , the need for a further development of alternative remedies to solve / overcome fertility problems other than art .", "finally , the ethical reflection on mit  also pursued through an appropriate use of clinical ethics committees could contribute to give meaning to objective limitations of cpg , granting further value to the human subject .", "this is one more reason to not immediately address the choices towards art , without first considering the relevant issues on distributive justice , fairness , and prioritization criteria of such expensive procedures [ 3436 ] ."], ["the role of the endocrinologist / andrologist is primary and necessary for a complete diagnostic evaluation and etiological therapeutic opportunity , as reported in a large series of pregnancies achieved in a single tertiary - care center experience .", "we confirmed previous data about the impossibility for semen parameters to lead to a clear - cut discrimination between fertile and infertile men .", "as a consequence , no patient should be automatically shifted towards art , even in presence of severe alterations in seminal parameters .", "art techniques should be considered after a sufficient time of etiological therapies , also according to ethical criteria of distributive justice , fairness , and prioritization .", "therefore , unique cpgs have not yet been developed regarding the indication and the timing for ivf techniques in relation to seminal parameters .", "these data should be therefore taken into consideration in evaluating current cpg for couple infertility . in this context ,",

mandibular protrusion in pigs.11 the present findings very likely reflect fundamental temporal differences in the response to stretch of masticatory muscles compared with limb muscles .", "this view is supported in a recent review article stating that masticatory muscles do not seem to follow this strict pattern of fiber transition.34 nevertheless , the rt - pcr and western blot results ,

expressing fibers disappear in the adult , widmer et al.31 localized these fibers in the masseter , albeit in a small number ( < 1% ) . in the present study , a few developmental myhc - expressing fibers were found in the masseter and most of these were of the neonatal type , although some embryonic myhc - expressing fibers were also found . to date , no other animal study has demonstrated changes in these fiber types in the masticatory muscles following the use of a bite - opening or protrusive appliance .", "easton and carlson11 reported that the percentage of slow fibers in this

control rabbits .", "further , they found an increase in the number of type i fibers and a 25% reduction in the number of iib fibers after using a mandibular protrusive appliance in rats.11 the shortening of the lateral pterygoid potentially reverses the transition of fiber types observed in the passive stretch model,14 because shortening or contraction of the lateral pterygoid would occur as the mandible is protruded downward and forward . in the present study , a significant difference in fiber types", "was not found between the experimental and the control groups except for the neonatal myhc - expressing fibers , which increased in percentage ( from 0% to 19% ) in the experimental group", ". however , increased mrna expression of myhc i and i suggests hyperactivity of the

observed in the present study .", "although others have suggested that this change also occurs in the masticatory muscles , the current findings do not support this view completely .", "changes in the masseter and lateral pterygoid are possibly more subtle than those in the limb muscles or take longer time to occur because of anatomical and functional differences .", "one of the reasons perhaps is that the masticatory muscles are predominantly fast muscles but contain a greater number of hybrid fibers than the edl.35 functional appliances for correction of malocclusions invariably stretch jaw

heavy chain ( myhc ) , the protein primarily responsible for the contractile speed and metabolism type of muscle fibers , are observable within days.1 when stretched , muscle fibers tend to change from a fast phenotype ( mainly comprising myhc iib ) to a slow phenotype ( consisting mainly of myhc i or rarely i).1 - 6 these changes , although controversial , occur along a continuum of changes in the expression of myhcs from isoform iib to iso form i.7 in addition , the expression of less common isoforms , such as embryonic or neonatal myhcs ( developmental myhcs ) , may also be increased.8 the same responses might occur in the masticatory muscles after an increase in occlusal vertical dimension and/or mandibular advancement.9,10 in animal models , functional appliances commonly used for orthodontic treatment induce a phenotypic change in masticatory muscle fibers , with a tendency toward transition to a slow phenotype.11,12 slow fibers are fatigue resistant and easily convertible to fast fibers ; in comparison , fast fibers are fatigable but difficult to convert to slow fibers .", "therefore , in a masticatory muscle stretched by a functional appliance , the fiber composition would gradually balance as the orofacial structures grow and then , treatment effects would be sustained without relapse provided that the new fiber proportion is maintained .", "however , a phenotypic change appears to occur only within the fast fiber population , and a definite molecular change among slow fibers remains controversial.9,10,13 the aims of this study were to examine

factors ( age , smoking , triglyceride , obesity ) . in the present study", ", we found a strong positive relationship between rbp4 and framingham score , composite of cvd risk factors , at the degree of visceral adiposity .", "in addition , the plasma level of rbp4 increased along the increase of determinants of metabolic syndrome , consistent with previous reports ( figure  1a ) .", "these

studied in an asian population study , and also agree with evidence linking specific visceral fat deposit to the increased risk of cvd .", "the opposite correlations of rbp4 and adiponectin for vat were consistent with studies of cultured visceral and subcutaneous adipocytes from humans and animal models .", "findings from these studies have shown that although both adiponectin gene expression and secretion are higher in visceral adipocytes , adiponectin secretion from adipocyte deposition decreases with increasing visceral obesity .", "this might partly explain the present results , in regard to a blunted protective effect of adiponectin on the cvd risk with increasing visceral obesity ( figure  2b ) .", "the underlying mechanism responsible for the interaction of these adipokines in situations of visceral fat deposit or metabolic syndrome with the cvd risk factors remains to be elucidated by future studies .", "crp has been identified as an effecter in the atherothrombotic process , and as a predictor of cvd risk among representative inflammatory markers in the clinical setting .", "however , the correlation between crp and framingham score did not reach statistical significance in multiple linear regression analysis .", "these findings suggest that correlations between crp and various atherosclerotic risk factors should be corrected for adiposity or adipokines , because the adipocyte itself is a known source of various inflammatory cytokines .", "first , the framingham risk ( represented as % ) could overestimate or underestimate the risk in populations other than the usa population .", "although it has not been established whether the framingham risk is suggested as a predictor of chd risk in korea , reasonable accuracy in predicting chd in an asian population had been shown in the past , and koreans were found to have a comparable cvd risk profile and their estimated 10year chd risk is currently almost as high as that in the general usa population .", "second , there are no previous data available for determining sample size for the present study .", "power calculations were based on the addition of a variable to an existing regression model with a r of 0.40.5 .", "a sample size of the present study provided 99.8% power at the 5% significance level for detecting an increase in the r of 0.05 or greater third , the

individuals with lower body obesity .", "although paradigms , such as the portal hypothesis and the endocrine hypothesis , have been suggested , the role of adipokines remains unknown .", "however , it is possible that adipokines might become more important with longerterm obesity or visceral fat deposit itself , when a pro or an antiinflammatory role of these adipokines might become an important factor .", "the present study showed that an increased plasma level of rbp4 in visceral fat accumulation , measured by ct , was associated with cvd risk factors independent of traditional cvd risk factors ( age , smoking , triglyceride , obesity ) . in the present study", ", we found a strong positive relationship between rbp4 and framingham score , composite of cvd risk factors , at the degree of visceral adiposity .", "in addition , the plasma level of rbp4 increased along the increase of determinants of metabolic syndrome , consistent with previous reports ( figure  1a ) .", "these

study , in which a correlation of rbp4 with abdominal obesity in participants with a wide range of bmi was shown , these findings let us suggest the possibility of an association between circulating rbp4 with specific fat deposits and a role of rbp4 in the associations of cvd risk factors .", "in addition , framingham scores in participants with the highest tertile of vat were not different between those with the lowest tertile of bmi and those with the highest tertile of bmi ( mean [ 95% ci ] , 5.6 [ 3.0 , 11.9 ] and 5.5 [ 7.7 , 10.4 ] , respectively , p  =  0.129 ) .", "however , there

studied in an asian population study , and also agree with evidence linking specific visceral fat deposit to the increased risk of cvd .", "the opposite correlations of rbp4 and adiponectin for vat were consistent with studies of cultured visceral and subcutaneous adipocytes from humans and animal models .", "findings from these studies have shown that although both adiponectin gene expression and secretion are higher in visceral adipocytes , adiponectin secretion from adipocyte deposition decreases with increasing visceral obesity .", "this might partly explain the present results , in regard to a blunted protective effect of adiponectin on the cvd risk with increasing visceral obesity ( figure  2b ) .", "the underlying mechanism responsible for the interaction of these adipokines in situations of visceral fat deposit or metabolic syndrome with the cvd risk factors remains to be elucidated by future studies .", "crp has been identified as an effecter in the atherothrombotic process , and as a predictor of cvd risk among representative inflammatory markers in the clinical setting .", "however , the correlation between crp and framingham score did not reach statistical significance in multiple linear regression analysis .", "these findings suggest that correlations between crp and various atherosclerotic risk factors should be corrected for adiposity or adipokines , because the adipocyte itself is a known source of various inflammatory cytokines .", "first , the framingham risk ( represented as % ) could overestimate or underestimate the risk in populations other than the usa population .", "although it has not been established whether the framingham risk is suggested as a predictor of chd risk in korea , reasonable accuracy in predicting chd in an asian population had been shown in the past , and koreans were found to have a comparable cvd risk profile and their estimated 10year chd risk is currently almost as high as that in the general usa population .", "second , there are no previous data available for determining sample size for the present study .", "power calculations were based on the addition of a variable to an existing regression model with a r of 0.40.5 .", "a sample size of the present study provided 99.8% power at the 5% significance level for detecting an increase in the r of 0.05 or greater third , the participants in the present study were a clinically narrow range from the perspective of overall risk ; as shown , 95.5% of study participants showed ", "thus , someone might argue that this cohort was neither heterogeneous nor representative of the general population .", "however , the purpose of the present study and cohort was to investigate the association of adiposity and cvd risk in healthy subjects without any known cvd diseased condition . despite the clinically narrow range from the perspective of overall risk , the study s findings showed the relevant relationship between plasma levels of rbp4 and cvd risk factors , represented by framingham score rather than framingham risk .", "finally , the crosssectional deign of the present study did not definitively establish the causal relationships .", "additional human studies using longitudinal study designs are required for further clarification of these relationships . in conclusion", "thus , rbp4 could play a role in the mediating deleterious effects of visceral obesity on the increased risk of cvd independent of traditional risk factors ."]]}, {"article_id": "PMC4283870", "article_text": ["w ostatnich latach

relief of symptoms [ 11 , 12 ] .", "renewed interest in beating - heart bypass grafting in the mid-1990s resulted from the option of revascularization without the potential complications of extracorporeal support .", "although the theoretical advantages of opcab procedures are generally accepted , the use of this technique still remains sporadic .", "for example , off - pump surgery constitutes only 20 to 25% of all coronary artery bypass procedures performed in the united states .", "a debatable issue is that of graft patency rates , which seem to be at least equivalent to those observed in the case of conventional techniques .", "the advantage of off - pump coronary artery bypass can be supported by such important factors as reduced morbidity and mortality , rapid return to usual functional capacity , and economic benefits .", "unfortunately , a lot of data reported in the literature concerning the outcomes of off - pump bypass grafting have been inconclusive as to the overall benefit of the technique .", "although the opcab technique eliminates cardiopulmonary bypass and hypothermic cardiac arrest , the manipulation of the ascending aorta by partial clamping has for the most part not been eliminated .", "so far , there have been 37 randomized clinical trials published , comparing opcab versus conventional cabg .", "no randomized trials have shown a significant reduction in the occurrence of stroke or myocardial infarction , acute renal failure , intra - aortic balloon pump ( iabp ) requirement , mediastinitis or wound infection , the recurrence
