control studies investigating this may have been limited by potential reporting bias , and exclusion of subjects who experienced fatal stroke , as the measure of exposure to stress was collected after onset of stroke.4 <br /> 9 <br /> 10 while some prospective studies have been performed,3 <br /> 5 limited duration of follow - up has not allowed examination of chronic exposure , which may be of particular relevance .<br />stress susceptibility  or stress resilience  is an important determinant of the consequences of exposure to stress.11 <br /> 12 a poorly controlled stress response ( potentially signalled by low stress resilience ) results in a prolonged physiological response to stressful exposures , thus increasing the possible longer - term adverse consequences of psychosocial stress .<br />stress resilience may be a useful and underused measure for investigating the consequences of chronic stress in relation to stroke risk .<br />here<br />, we examine the association of stress resilience in adolescence with subsequent stroke risk in middle age within a general population - based cohort of male swedish residents .<br />stress resilience was measured during the assessment for military conscription over 10  years prior to stroke and , therefore , not subject to differential reporting bias .<br />a secondary aim was to examine whether other risk factors might mediate associations of stress resilience with stroke risk .<br />at the end of follow - up<br />the subjects were still relatively young , under age 60  years , so the study is of stroke risk during working age rather than the later ages when stroke is more common .<br />the study cohort consists of male swedish residents born between 1952 and 1956 , who were eligible for military conscription and included in the swedish military conscription register.13 at this time , conscription and the associated examinations were mandatory for all male citizens of the appropriate age ( 18 and 19  years , with a small number at later ages ) .<br />during the years covered by this study , only men with significant disability or a severe chronic disease were exempted from conscription ( approximately 23% annually).14 the assessments included extensive and highly standardised physical and psychological examinations by physicians and psychologists .<br />stroke risk was assessed from 1987 ( when the swedish national inpatient register15 attained full coverage ) to 2010 .<br />from among a total of 284  198 men<br />identified , we excluded 2564 subjects with unreliable data such as errors in the personal identification number or uncertain vital status .<br />those with implausible values for height ( less than 144  cm ) , weight ( above 178  kg ) , body mass index , bmi , ( below 15 ) , systolic blood pressure ( below 50 or above 230  mm  hg ) and diastolic blood pressure ( below 30 or above 135  mm  hg ) , were also excluded from the analysis ; in total 225 men.16 after excluding individuals who emigrated , died , or had a diagnosis of stroke before study entry in 1987 , the sample comprised 271  767 men .<br />men with missing data for stress resilience , potential confounding factors ( year of birth , geographic region , systolic and diastolic blood pressure , bmi , cognitive function , physical working capacity , parental socioeconomic index and household crowding ) were also excluded ( 37  196 men ; including 722 men with a stroke diagnosis at some time ) .<br />the sample available for the main analysis comprised 237  879 men , 84% of the potential target population .<br />the men underwent a psychological examination to assess their potential ability to cope with war - time stress,17 based on the ability to control and channel nervousness , tolerance of stress and disposition to anxiety.18 during this assessment , the potential conscripts met a psychologist for a semistructured interview which covered areas relevant to general everyday life ; including psychosocial dimensions , such as social maturity , leisure interests , psychological motivation , and emotional stability.18 this interview was used to produce a stress resilience score from 1 to 9 which we grouped into low ( 13 ) , medium ( 46 ) and high ( 79 ) .<br />details of the test are available in swedish,19 and it has been used in published research.16<br />17 to ensure consistent evaluation , a central authority supervised the instruction and training of participating psychologists , supported by a written manual .<br />height and weight were used to calculate bmi , which was categorised using the who criteria .<br />systolic and diastolic blood pressure was measured after rest in recumbent men using a sphygmomanometer .<br />physical working capacity was assessed using the cycle ergonometric test .<br />after a normal resting electrocardiogram ,<br />5  min of submaximal exercise was performed at different work rates depending on body mass , directly followed by a maximal test with gradually increasing load until volitional exhaustion , or an estimate was derived from a nomogram for men who did not complete the full duration .<br />the cognitive test was a written assessment and comprised four domains : linguistic understanding , spatial recognition , general knowledge and ability to follow mechanical instructions : the results were transformed into a single score with a value ranging from 1 to 9 .<br />from the medical assessment at conscription , we identified diagnoses , and we used the international classification of diseases eighth revision , icd-8 , icd-8 codes 393458 to indicate diagnosis of any cardiovascular disease at the time of conscription . using the swedish national inpatient register15 exlude and the cause of death register,20 we identified the dates of first fatal and non -

fatal and fatal stroke were examined together and separately .<br />in the analyses of aetiological subtypes ( ischaemic and intracerebral haemorrhagic stroke ) , first event by each subtype was used .<br />associations were examined using an unadjusted ( model 1 ) and three further adjusted models .<br />in model 2 , adjustment was for demographic and socioeconomic factors for the family of origin : birth year , geographical region , parents socioeconomic index , and household crowding .<br />model 3 was additionally adjusted for characteristics in adolescence : cognitive function ( continuous ) , systolic and diastolic blood pressure ( continuous ) , and cardiovascular disease at conscription .<br />in model 4<br />lifestyle factors in adolescence ( here represented by physical fitness and body mass ) were also added to the model : bmi ( in 4 categories ) and physical working capacity score ( continuous ) .<br />the proportional hazards assumption for stress resilience in relation to stroke was tested graphically , as well as using a test based on schoenfeld residuals , and no evidence was found that it was violated .<br />as this was assessed using age as the underlying time scale , it indicates that the association between stress resilience and stroke was constant and did not diminish with increasing age .<br />the study cohort consists of male swedish residents born between 1952 and 1956 , who were eligible for military conscription and included in the swedish military conscription register.13 at this time , conscription and the associated examinations were mandatory for all male citizens of the appropriate age ( 18 and 19  years , with a small number at later ages ) .<br />during the years covered by this study , only men with significant disability or a severe chronic disease were exempted from conscription ( approximately 23% annually).14 the assessments included extensive and highly standardised physical and psychological examinations by physicians and psychologists .<br />stroke risk was assessed from 1987 ( when the swedish national inpatient register15 attained full coverage ) to 2010 .<br />from among a total of 284  198 men<br />identified , we excluded 2564 subjects with unreliable data such as errors in the personal identification number or uncertain vital status .<br />those with implausible values for height ( less than 144  cm ) , weight ( above 178  kg ) , body mass index , bmi , ( below 15 ) , systolic blood pressure ( below 50 or above 230  mm  hg ) and diastolic blood pressure ( below 30 or above 135  mm  hg ) , were also excluded from the analysis ; in total 225 men.16 after excluding individuals who emigrated , died , or had a diagnosis of stroke before study entry in 1987 , the sample comprised 271  767 men .<br />men with missing data for stress resilience , potential confounding factors ( year of birth , geographic region , systolic and diastolic blood pressure , bmi , cognitive function , physical working capacity , parental socioeconomic index and household crowding ) were also excluded ( 37  196 men ; including 722 men with a stroke diagnosis at some time ) .<br />the sample available for the main analysis comprised 237  879 men , 84% of the potential target population .<br />the men underwent a psychological examination to assess their potential ability to cope with war -

up in 1987 .<br />during the follow - up period of 19872010 ,<br />3411 men ( 1.4% ) received an inpatient diagnosis of stroke ( or stroke was recorded as the underlying cause of death ) .<br />the stroke incidence rate was 64 per 100  000 person - years in our study population , compared with 101 per 100  000 person - years in the excluded subset with missing data on covariates .<br />men with low resilience tended to have lower physical capacity , lower cognitive function scores , higher blood pressure , were underweight , overweight or obese , more often had a diagnosis of cardiovascular disease at conscription , and had parents with a lower socioeconomic index and experienced greater household crowding in childhood .<br />population ( n=237  879 ) characteristics by stress resilience levels cvd , cardiovascular disease ; sei , socioeconomic index .<br />the associations with stroke for stress resilience and the other measures are reported in table 2 .<br />the lowest stress resilience group ( 21.8% with scores 13 ) compared with the highest ( 23.7% with score 79 ) was associated with increased risk of all stroke types .<br />the intermediate category of stress resilience lay between the low and high groups , indicating a graded association .<br />when adjusted for the demographic and socioeconomic factors in childhood , the association attenuated slightly but remained statistically significant .<br />additional adjustment for health and development characteristics in adolescence<br />further adjustment for physical fitness indicated by bmi and physical capacity had the most notable impact on the hrs , but despite the reduction in magnitude , statistical significance remained .<br />blood pressure was modelled as continuous variables to ensure the most effective adjustment : the magnitude of the associations appears small as the hrs are for each unit change per mm  hg , but statistical significance for associations with stroke remained after adjustment for all other measures .<br />/ material background factors ( birth year , region , parental sei and household crowding ) .<br />model 3 . adjusted for 2 + characteristics in adolescence ( cognitive function , diastolic and systolic blood pressure and cvd diagnosis at conscription ) .<br />model 4 . adjusted for 2 + 3 + physical fitness in adolescence ( physical working capacity and bmi ) .<br />table  3 presents the outcomes for the stroke subgroups , fatal ( n=308 ) , ischaemic ( n=2060 ) and intracerebral haemorrhagic ( n=676 ) stroke .<br />all showed a significant association with stress resilience , with higher magnitude associations for fatal than non - fatal stroke ; and for haemorrhagic than ischaemic stroke .<br />in adjusted models , a similar pattern as for all stroke appeared , but the association of stress resilience and ischaemic stroke was more notably attenuated by adjustment for bmi and physical capacity .<br />stress resilience and stroke subdivided by stroke characteristics model 2 . adjusted for socio / material background factors ( birth year , region , parents sei , household crowding ) .<br />model 3 . adjusted for 2 + characteristics in adolescence ( cognition , systolic and diastolic blood pressure , cvd diagnosis at conscription ) .<br />model 4 . adjusted for 2 + 3+physical fitness in adolescence ( physical working capacity and bmi ) .<br />low stress resilience in adolescence was associated with a higher risk of stroke in men of working age between 31 years and 58  years , a relatively young age group to experience stroke .<br />this association was independent of childhood socioeconomic circumstances , as well as health and developmental characteristics in adolescence .<br />the association was attenuated more notably ( but not eliminated ) by adjustment for bmi and physical working capacity as indicators of physical fitness in adolescence , likely to signal future lifestyle characteristics .<br />our results from a general population - based cohort of men are consistent with recent studies suggesting a role for psychosocial stress in influencing stroke risk.35 <br /> 9 <br /> 10 similarly , poorer adaptation to social adversity  possibly signalling lower stress resilience  has also been linked with an increased risk of stroke.22 stress resilience in adolescence does not measure exposure to stress but does indicate susceptibility , such that the adversities of daily life may have a greater impact and conspire to produce a more chronic pattern stress arousal over adult life .<br />another study has found associations with stress independent of lifestyle factors.4 this difference with our findings may be due to methodological variations , as we have a measure of resilience rather than stress exposure , it was collected prospectively , many years before stroke , and we adjusted for some characteristics in adolescence that may themselves be consequences of low stress resilience , as discussed below .<br />we hypothesise that low resilience to psychosocial stress could indicate exposure to psychosocial stress in earlier life , resulting in poorer control of the stress response that can continue across the life course .<br />animal studies have demonstrated that early life stress can alter hpa axis function in a way that can persist over the life course , producing persistent low resilience to stress.23<br />24 stress resilience may also be a characteristic of personality type , and thus , a persistent trait .<br />for example , low resilience may reflect something like type a behaviour which , although controversial , has previously been related to increased cardiovascular risk.25<br />it has been demonstrated that adverse socioeconomic conditions in childhood increase stroke risk26 ; so we adjusted for such factors , with little impact on the association of stress resilience with stroke .<br />markers of early life exposure to stress have been linked with poorer cognitive development27 and higher blood pressure.28 thus , cognitive function and blood pressure may represent consequences of earlier stressful exposures and poorer stress resilience , and adjusting for these factors may have produced conservative estimates of association ; arguably an over - adjustment .<br />markers of stressful exposures in early life are also linked with unhealthy weight gain,29 which may influence physical exercise or be a consequence of low exercise levels.30 thus , even in adolescence , bmi and fitness could , in part , be a consequence of lower stress resilience and earlier stressful exposures .<br />we believe the results suggest that a significant proportion of the association of stress and stress resilience with stroke risk is due to lifestyle risk factors .<br />this is consistent with recent findings from a british cohort study with older participants , where the association of psychological distress with cvd risk was largely explained by behavioural / lifestyle processes.31 our findings suggest such processes have a long natural history , beginning in childhood or adolescence .<br />our results were consistent among the different stroke subtypes ( fatal , non - fatal , ischaemic and intracerebral haemorrhagic stroke ) although there may be pathological heterogeneity .<br />previous studies investigating the association between psychosocial stress and stroke subtypes are few , but the results are mostly consistent with our findings suggesting a more notable association for fatal than for non - fatal stroke , and for haemorrhagic than ischaemic stroke<br />.<br />the stronger association with haemorrhagic than ischaemic stroke could also be a consequence of a greater aetiological heterogeneity in ischaemic stroke .<br />physical working capacity and bmi in adolescence most notably attenuated that association of stress resilience with ischaemic stroke , suggesting more significant mediation through lifestyle factors .<br />as this is a study of stress resilience measured in adolescence , it is possible that stressful exposures in adult life might represent a higher risk of stroke , particularly chronic exposures among the less stress resilient .<br />overweight , obesity and poorer physical capacity in adolescence are likely to signal an accumulation of behavioural / lifestyle health risks that continue through adulthood.32<br />33 other lifestyle risks in the years between conscription and stroke , such as smoking , alcohol and diet , are also likely to be relevant mediating factors .<br />further mediating factors might include type 2 diabetes , a stroke risk which tends to have its onset in adulthood some years after the time of conscription , which has also been linked with psychosocial stress.34 <br /> 35 as behaviours and diagnoses occurring between conscription and stroke are intermediate in the causal pathway , we have not included them in the model .<br />unfortunately , we have no data on smoking , diet or alcohol consumption , which could have added further to our understanding of lifestyle risks .<br />thus , major mediation between poor stress resilience and stroke risk may be through lifestyle factors and fitness , suggesting interventions for psychosocial stress and behaviour might be most effective in lowering stoke risk among younger men .<br />the use of prospectively recorded data from several linked registers , and the long - term follow - up subsequent to the measure of susceptibility , increases the validity and reliability of the study , as well as avoiding bias due to reverse causation or poor recall .<br />the study population is largely representative of the male general population as only a small proportion of swedish men were exempted from enlistment examinations .<br />extensive physical and psychological examinations were conducted in adolescence , so the information was objectively measured and were able to adjust for a variety of powerful stroke risk factors including , bmi and physical capacity which are objective physiological measures .<br />the duration between conscription examination and start of follow - up means it is unlikely that prodromal characteristics of an impending stroke were driving the stress resilience measure , and it was possible to identify pre - existing cardiovascular diagnoses and adjust for blood pressure .<br />the potential limitations of the study include the inclusion of only men , as women also suffer from stroke .<br />this was necessary as the measure of stress susceptibility was collected during military conscription , which at the time was almost exclusively available to men .<br />as stress resilience<br />was only measured once , we can not be definitive about stability of this characteristic over time and how this may interact with stressful exposures . in these data ,<br />the association of stress resilience with stroke risk did not vary by age , indicating that this measure of stress resilience is a relatively stable characteristic over time , at least in terms of stroke risk .<br />there is a possibility of misclassification of the stress resilience measure if potential conscripts attempted to obtain exemption from military service through<br />false answers , if they exist , would most likely dilute the resilience measure and result in less precise estimates .<br />the temporal relationship of stress resilience and physical fitness in adolescence can not be established , but we hypothesise that poor stress resilience has an adverse influence on physical fitness .<br />as stressful exposures were not examined , it is possible that the magnitude of associations with stress resilience is conservative<br />.<br />a proportion of the cardiovascular diagnoses at conscription when the men in our cohort were 1819 years old may not be directly relevant to stroke risk .<br />we included this information in the models to ensure that poorer stress resilience was not a function of pre - existing cardiovascular disease , where a proportion of these diseases may increase subsequent stroke risk .<br />most stroke onset occurs at a higher age than in our study , so early stroke may be somewhat atypical and the aetiology may differ from stroke at older ages.36 however , stroke incidence in younger adults ( younger than 55  years of age ) is increasing.37 stroke at young ( working ) age is a particular concern , as a reduction of working capacity increases the personal , social as well as economic burden of the disease .<br />this is of public health significance , as stroke at early ages has the potential for greater lifetime burden of disability , and because some risks may be modifiable .<br />the proportion of stroke diagnoses in the analytic sample is lower than among those who were not included .<br />this is for two reasons , and the first is that men who had a stroke at an early age , close in time to the conscription examination , were excluded deliberately to avoid associations due to reverse causation .<br />some men in poor health , with very low levels of physical fitness , or low cognitive function at the time of the conscription examination , were identified as unsuitable for military service by the assessors and may not have completed all the examinations ( including for stress resilience ) .<br />as these men  excluded due to missing values on the assessments  may have the greatest risk of stroke , we may have underestimated the proportion at risk and conceivably produced a conservative estimate of stroke risk .<br />the validity of some diagnoses recorded in the swedish national inpatient register can be questionable , but the reliability of stroke diagnoses is satisfactory.38 <br /> 39<br />the use of prospectively recorded data from several linked registers , and the long -

existing cardiovascular disease , where a proportion of these diseases may increase subsequent stroke risk .<br />most stroke onset occurs at a higher age than in our study , so early stroke may be somewhat atypical and the aetiology may differ from stroke at older ages.36 however , stroke incidence in younger adults ( younger than 55  years of age ) is increasing.37 stroke at young ( working ) age is a particular concern , as a reduction of working capacity increases the personal , social as well as economic burden of the disease .<br />this is of public health significance , as stroke at early ages has the potential for greater lifetime burden of disability , and because some risks may be modifiable .<br />the proportion of stroke diagnoses in the analytic sample is lower than among those who were not included .<br />this is for two reasons , and the first is that men who had a stroke at an early age , close in time to the conscription examination , were excluded deliberately to avoid associations due to reverse causation .<br />some men in poor health , with very low levels of physical fitness , or low cognitive function at the time of the conscription examination , were identified as unsuitable for military service by the assessors and may not have completed all the examinations ( including for stress resilience ) .<br />as these men  excluded due to missing values on the assessments  may have the greatest risk of stroke , we may have underestimated the proportion at risk and conceivably produced a conservative estimate of stroke risk .<br />the validity of some diagnoses recorded in the swedish national inpatient register can be questionable , but the reliability of stroke diagnoses is satisfactory.38<br />39<br />the association with stress resilience suggests that stress may be implicated in the aetiology of stroke , which is , in part , explained by poorer physical fitness among the less stress resilient .<br />we hypothesise that the most effective interventions to prevent stroke would focus on behaviour and lifestyle factors , as well as psychosocial stress .", "summary": "backgroundstress is a risk factor for stroke, but studies investigating the association between stress and stroke risk are limited by potential reporting bias and exclusion of individuals who experienced fatal stroke. limited data are available on stress resilience, which may be a useful determinant of exposure to stress and stroke risk.methodsin a population - based cohort of men born between 1956 and 1952, military conscription was mandatory for all swedish men, aged 18 and 19 years. stress resilience was measured during this period and, at age 31, we examined the association of stress resilience with subsequent stroke risk during working age, under 60 years. stress resilience was measured using a semistructured interview with a psychologist, who rated the perceived level of stress based on responses to a set of questions. stroke cases were identified in the general population ( n=237 879 ) during a median follow - up of 23.0 years.resultsin multivariate analyses, subjects with low stress resilience had an increased risk of ischemic stroke ( hazard ratio [ hr ] 2.17, 95% confidence interval [ ci ] 1.73 to 2.40 ) after adjustment for potential confounding factors. the association was attenuated by the addition of smoking status, but not by other lifestyle factors.conclusionslow stress resilience is associated with an increased stroke risk in middle -

control studies investigating this may have been limited by potential reporting bias , and exclusion of subjects who experienced fatal stroke , as the measure of exposure to stress was collected after onset of stroke.4 <br /> 9 <br /> 10 while some prospective studies have been performed,3 <br /> 5 limited duration of follow - up has not allowed examination of chronic exposure , which may be of particular relevance .<br />stress susceptibility  or stress resilience  is an important determinant of the consequences of exposure to stress.11 <br /> 12 a poorly controlled stress response ( potentially signalled by low stress resilience ) results in a prolonged physiological response to stressful exposures , thus increasing the possible longer - term adverse consequences of psychosocial stress .<br />stress resilience may be a useful and underused measure for investigating the consequences of chronic stress in relation to stroke risk .<br />here<br />, we examine the association of stress resilience in adolescence with subsequent stroke risk in middle age within a general population - based cohort of male swedish residents .<br />stress resilience was measured during the assessment for military conscription over 10  years prior to stroke and , therefore , not subject to differential reporting bias .<br />a secondary aim was to examine whether other risk factors might mediate associations of stress resilience with stroke risk .<br />at the end of follow - up<br />the subjects were still relatively young , under age 60  years , so the study is of stroke risk during working age rather than the later ages when stroke is more common .<br />the study cohort consists of male swedish residents born between 1952 and 1956 , who were eligible for military conscription and included in the swedish military conscription register.13 at this time , conscription and the associated examinations were mandatory for all male citizens of the appropriate age ( 18 and 19  years , with a small number at later ages ) .<br />during the years covered by this study , only men with significant disability or a severe chronic disease were exempted from conscription ( approximately 23% annually).14 the assessments included extensive and highly standardised physical and psychological examinations by physicians and psychologists .<br />stroke risk was assessed from 1987 ( when the swedish national inpatient register15 attained full coverage ) to 2010 .<br />from among a total of 284  198 men<br />identified , we excluded 2564 subjects with unreliable data such as errors in the personal identification number or uncertain vital status .<br />those with implausible values for height ( less than 144  cm ) , weight ( above 178  kg ) , body mass index , bmi , ( below 15 ) , systolic blood pressure ( below 50 or above 230  mm  hg ) and diastolic blood pressure ( below 30 or above 135  mm  hg ) , were also excluded from the analysis ; in total 225 men.16 after excluding individuals who emigrated , died , or had a diagnosis of stroke before study entry in 1987 , the sample comprised 271  767 men .<br />men with missing data for stress resilience , potential confounding factors ( year of birth , geographic region , systolic and diastolic blood pressure , bmi , cognitive function , physical working capacity , parental socioeconomic index and household crowding ) were also excluded ( 37  196 men ; including 722 men with a stroke diagnosis at some time ) .<br />the sample available for the main analysis comprised 237  879 men , 84% of the potential target population .<br />the men underwent a psychological examination to assess their potential ability to cope with war - time stress,17 based on the ability to control and channel nervousness , tolerance of stress and disposition to anxiety.18 during this assessment , the potential conscripts met a psychologist for a semistructured interview which covered areas relevant to general everyday life ; including psychosocial dimensions , such as social maturity , leisure interests , psychological motivation , and emotional stability.18 this interview was used to produce a stress resilience score from 1 to 9 which we grouped into low ( 13 ) , medium ( 46 ) and high ( 79 ) .<br />details of the test are available in swedish,19 and it has been used in published research.16<br />17 to ensure consistent evaluation , a central authority supervised the instruction and training of participating psychologists , supported by a written manual .<br />height and weight were used to calculate bmi , which was categorised using the who criteria .<br />systolic and diastolic blood pressure was measured after rest in recumbent men using a sphygmomanometer .<br />physical working capacity was assessed using the cycle ergonometric test .<br />after a normal resting electrocardiogram ,<br />5  min of submaximal exercise was performed at different work rates depending on body mass , directly followed by a maximal test with gradually increasing load until volitional exhaustion , or an estimate was derived from a nomogram for men who did not complete the full duration .<br />the cognitive test was a written assessment and comprised four domains : linguistic understanding , spatial recognition , general knowledge and ability to follow mechanical instructions : the results were transformed into a single score with a value ranging from 1 to 9 .<br />from the medical assessment at conscription , we identified diagnoses , and we used the international classification of diseases eighth revision , icd-8 , icd-8 codes 393458 to indicate diagnosis of any cardiovascular disease at the time of conscription . using the swedish national inpatient register15 exlude and the cause of death register,20 we identified the dates of first fatal and non -

fatal and fatal stroke were examined together and separately .<br />in the analyses of aetiological subtypes ( ischaemic and intracerebral haemorrhagic stroke ) , first event by each subtype was used .<br />associations were examined using an unadjusted ( model 1 ) and three further adjusted models .<br />in model 2 , adjustment was for demographic and socioeconomic factors for the family of origin : birth year , geographical region , parents socioeconomic index , and household crowding .<br />model 3 was additionally adjusted for characteristics in adolescence : cognitive function ( continuous ) , systolic and diastolic blood pressure ( continuous ) , and cardiovascular disease at conscription .<br />in model 4<br />lifestyle factors in adolescence ( here represented by physical fitness and body mass ) were also added to the model : bmi ( in 4 categories ) and physical working capacity score ( continuous ) .<br />the proportional hazards assumption for stress resilience in relation to stroke was tested graphically , as well as using a test based on schoenfeld residuals , and no evidence was found that it was violated .<br />as this was assessed using age as the underlying time scale , it indicates that the association between stress resilience and stroke was constant and did not diminish with increasing age .<br />the study cohort consists of male swedish residents born between 1952 and 1956 , who were eligible for military conscription and included in the swedish military conscription register.13 at this time , conscription and the associated examinations were mandatory for all male citizens of the appropriate age ( 18 and 19  years , with a small number at later ages ) .<br />during the years covered by this study , only men with significant disability or a severe chronic disease were exempted from conscription ( approximately 23% annually).14 the assessments included extensive and highly standardised physical and psychological examinations by physicians and psychologists .<br />stroke risk was assessed from 1987 ( when the swedish national inpatient register15 attained full coverage ) to 2010 .<br />from among a total of 284  198 men<br />identified , we excluded 2564 subjects with unreliable data such as errors in the personal identification number or uncertain vital status .<br />those with implausible values for height ( less than 144  cm ) , weight ( above 178  kg ) , body mass index , bmi , ( below 15 ) , systolic blood pressure ( below 50 or above 230  mm  hg ) and diastolic blood pressure ( below 30 or above 135  mm  hg ) , were also excluded from the analysis ; in total 225 men.16 after excluding individuals who emigrated , died , or had a diagnosis of stroke before study entry in 1987 , the sample comprised 271  767 men .<br />men with missing data for stress resilience , potential confounding factors ( year of birth , geographic region , systolic and diastolic blood pressure , bmi , cognitive function , physical working capacity , parental socioeconomic index and household crowding ) were also excluded ( 37  196 men ; including 722 men with a stroke diagnosis at some time ) .<br />the sample available for the main analysis comprised 237  879 men , 84% of the potential target population .<br />the men underwent a psychological examination to assess their potential ability to cope with war -

up in 1987 .<br />during the follow - up period of 19872010 ,<br />3411 men ( 1.4% ) received an inpatient diagnosis of stroke ( or stroke was recorded as the underlying cause of death ) .<br />the stroke incidence rate was 64 per 100  000 person - years in our study population , compared with 101 per 100  000 person - years in the excluded subset with missing data on covariates .<br />men with low resilience tended to have lower physical capacity , lower cognitive function scores , higher blood pressure , were underweight , overweight or obese , more often had a diagnosis of cardiovascular disease at conscription , and had parents with a lower socioeconomic index and experienced greater household crowding in childhood .<br />population ( n=237  879 ) characteristics by stress resilience levels cvd , cardiovascular disease ; sei , socioeconomic index .<br />the associations with stroke for stress resilience and the other measures are reported in table 2 .<br />the lowest stress resilience group ( 21.8% with scores 13 ) compared with the highest ( 23.7% with score 79 ) was associated with increased risk of all stroke types .<br />the intermediate category of stress resilience lay between the low and high groups , indicating a graded association .<br />when adjusted for the demographic and socioeconomic factors in childhood , the association attenuated slightly but remained statistically significant .<br />additional adjustment for health and development characteristics in adolescence<br />further adjustment for physical fitness indicated by bmi and physical capacity had the most notable impact on the hrs , but despite the reduction in magnitude , statistical significance remained .<br />blood pressure was modelled as continuous variables to ensure the most effective adjustment : the magnitude of the associations appears small as the hrs are for each unit change per mm  hg , but statistical significance for associations with stroke remained after adjustment for all other measures .<br />/ material background factors ( birth year , region , parental sei and household crowding ) .<br />model 3 . adjusted for 2 + characteristics in adolescence ( cognitive function , diastolic and systolic blood pressure and cvd diagnosis at conscription ) .<br />model 4 . adjusted for 2 + 3 + physical fitness in adolescence ( physical working capacity and bmi ) .<br />table  3 presents the outcomes for the stroke subgroups , fatal ( n=308 ) , ischaemic ( n=2060 ) and intracerebral haemorrhagic ( n=676 ) stroke .<br />all showed a significant association with stress resilience , with higher magnitude associations for fatal than non - fatal stroke ; and for haemorrhagic than ischaemic stroke .<br />in adjusted models , a similar pattern as for all stroke appeared , but the association of stress resilience and ischaemic stroke was more notably attenuated by adjustment for bmi and physical capacity .<br />stress resilience and stroke subdivided by stroke characteristics model 2 . adjusted for socio / material background factors ( birth year , region , parents sei , household crowding ) .<br />model 3 . adjusted for 2 + characteristics in adolescence ( cognition , systolic and diastolic blood pressure , cvd diagnosis at conscription ) .<br />model 4 . adjusted for 2 + 3+physical fitness in adolescence ( physical working capacity and bmi ) .<br />low stress resilience in adolescence was associated with a higher risk of stroke in men of working age between 31 years and 58  years , a relatively young age group to experience stroke .<br />this association was independent of childhood socioeconomic circumstances , as well as health and developmental characteristics in adolescence .<br />the association was attenuated more notably ( but not eliminated ) by adjustment for bmi and physical working capacity as indicators of physical fitness in adolescence , likely to signal future lifestyle characteristics .<br />our results from a general population - based cohort of men are consistent with recent studies suggesting a role for psychosocial stress in influencing stroke risk.35 <br /> 9 <br /> 10 similarly , poorer adaptation to social adversity  possibly signalling lower stress resilience  has also been linked with an increased risk of stroke.22 stress resilience in adolescence does not measure exposure to stress but does indicate susceptibility , such that the adversities of daily life may have a greater impact and conspire to produce a more chronic pattern stress arousal over adult life .<br />another study has found associations with stress independent of lifestyle factors.4 this difference with our findings may be due to methodological variations , as we have a measure of resilience rather than stress exposure , it was collected prospectively , many years before stroke , and we adjusted for some characteristics in adolescence that may themselves be consequences of low stress resilience , as discussed below .<br />we hypothesise that low resilience to psychosocial stress could indicate exposure to psychosocial stress in earlier life , resulting in poorer control of the stress response that can continue across the life course .<br />animal studies have demonstrated that early life stress can alter hpa axis function in a way that can persist over the life course , producing persistent low resilience to stress.23<br />24 stress resilience may also be a characteristic of personality type , and thus , a persistent trait .<br />for example , low resilience may reflect something like type a behaviour which , although controversial , has previously been related to increased cardiovascular risk.25<br />it has been demonstrated that adverse socioeconomic conditions in childhood increase stroke risk26 ; so we adjusted for such factors , with little impact on the association of stress resilience with stroke .<br />markers of early life exposure to stress have been linked with poorer cognitive development27 and higher blood pressure.28 thus , cognitive function and blood pressure may represent consequences of earlier stressful exposures and poorer stress resilience , and adjusting for these factors may have produced conservative estimates of association ; arguably an over - adjustment .<br />markers of stressful exposures in early life are also linked with unhealthy weight gain,29 which may influence physical exercise or be a consequence of low exercise levels.30 thus , even in adolescence , bmi and fitness could , in part , be a consequence of lower stress resilience and earlier stressful exposures .<br />we believe the results suggest that a significant proportion of the association of stress and stress resilience with stroke risk is due to lifestyle risk factors .<br />this is consistent with recent findings from a british cohort study with older participants , where the association of psychological distress with cvd risk was largely explained by behavioural / lifestyle processes.31 our findings suggest such processes have a long natural history , beginning in childhood or adolescence .<br />our results were consistent among the different stroke subtypes ( fatal , non - fatal , ischaemic and intracerebral haemorrhagic stroke ) although there may be pathological heterogeneity .<br />previous studies investigating the association between psychosocial stress and stroke subtypes are few , but the results are mostly consistent with our findings suggesting a more notable association for fatal than for non - fatal stroke , and for haemorrhagic than ischaemic stroke<br />.<br />the stronger association with haemorrhagic than ischaemic stroke could also be a consequence of a greater aetiological heterogeneity in ischaemic stroke .<br />physical working capacity and bmi in adolescence most notably attenuated that association of stress resilience with ischaemic stroke , suggesting more significant mediation through lifestyle factors .<br />as this is a study of stress resilience measured in adolescence , it is possible that stressful exposures in adult life might represent a higher risk of stroke , particularly chronic exposures among the less stress resilient .<br />overweight , obesity and poorer physical capacity in adolescence are likely to signal an accumulation of behavioural / lifestyle health risks that continue through adulthood.32<br />33 other lifestyle risks in the years between conscription and stroke , such as smoking , alcohol and diet , are also likely to be relevant mediating factors .<br />further mediating factors might include type 2 diabetes , a stroke risk which tends to have its onset in adulthood some years after the time of conscription , which has also been linked with psychosocial stress.34 <br /> 35 as behaviours and diagnoses occurring between conscription and stroke are intermediate in the causal pathway , we have not included them in the model .<br />unfortunately , we have no data on smoking , diet or alcohol consumption , which could have added further to our understanding of lifestyle risks .<br />thus , major mediation between poor stress resilience and stroke risk may be through lifestyle factors and fitness , suggesting interventions for psychosocial stress and behaviour might be most effective in lowering stoke risk among younger men .<br />the use of prospectively recorded data from several linked registers , and the long -

control studies investigating this may have been limited by potential reporting bias , and exclusion of subjects who experienced fatal stroke , as the measure of exposure to stress was collected after onset of stroke.4 <br /> 9 <br /> 10 while some prospective studies have been performed,3 <br /> 5 limited duration of follow - up has not allowed examination of chronic exposure , which may be of particular relevance .<br />stress susceptibility  or stress resilience  is an important determinant of the consequences of exposure to stress.11 <br /> 12 a poorly controlled stress response ( potentially signalled by low stress resilience ) results in a prolonged physiological response to stressful exposures , thus increasing the possible longer - term adverse consequences of psychosocial stress .<br />stress resilience may be a useful and underused measure for investigating the consequences of chronic stress in relation to stroke risk .<br />here<br />, we examine the association of stress resilience in adolescence with subsequent stroke risk in middle age within a general population - based cohort of male swedish residents .<br />stress resilience was measured during the assessment for military conscription over 10  years prior to stroke and , therefore , not subject to differential reporting bias .<br />a secondary aim was to examine whether other risk factors might mediate associations of stress resilience with stroke risk .<br />at the end of follow - up<br />the subjects were still relatively young , under age 60  years , so the study is of stroke risk during working age rather than the later ages when stroke is more common .<br />the study cohort consists of male swedish residents born between 1952 and 1956 , who were eligible for military conscription and included in the swedish military conscription register.13 at this time , conscription and the associated examinations were mandatory for all male citizens of the appropriate age ( 18 and 19  years , with a small number at later ages ) .<br />during the years covered by this study , only men with significant disability or a severe chronic disease were exempted from conscription ( approximately 23% annually).14 the assessments included extensive and highly standardised physical and psychological examinations by physicians and psychologists .<br />stroke risk was assessed from 1987 ( when the swedish national inpatient register15 attained full coverage ) to 2010 .<br />from among a total of 284  198 men<br />identified , we excluded 2564 subjects with unreliable data such as errors in the personal identification number or uncertain vital status .<br />those with implausible values for height ( less than 144  cm ) , weight ( above 178  kg ) , body mass index , bmi , ( below 15 ) , systolic blood pressure ( below 50 or above 230  mm  hg ) and diastolic blood pressure ( below 30 or above 135  mm  hg ) , were also excluded from the analysis ; in total 225 men.16 after excluding individuals who emigrated , died , or had a diagnosis of stroke before study entry in 1987 , the sample comprised 271  767 men .<br />men with missing data for stress resilience , potential confounding factors ( year of birth , geographic region , systolic and diastolic blood pressure , bmi , cognitive function , physical working capacity , parental socioeconomic index and household crowding ) were also excluded ( 37  196 men ; including 722 men with a stroke diagnosis at some time ) .<br />the sample available for the main analysis comprised 237  879 men , 84% of the potential target population .<br />the men underwent a psychological examination to assess their potential ability to cope with war - time stress,17 based on the ability to control and channel nervousness , tolerance of stress and disposition to anxiety.18 during this assessment , the potential conscripts met a psychologist for a semistructured interview which covered areas relevant to general everyday life ; including psychosocial dimensions , such as social maturity , leisure interests , psychological motivation , and emotional stability.18 this interview was used to produce a stress resilience score from 1 to 9 which we grouped into low ( 13 ) , medium ( 46 ) and high ( 79 ) .<br />details of the test are available in swedish,19 and it has been used in published research.16<br />17 to ensure consistent evaluation , a central authority supervised the instruction and training of participating psychologists , supported by a written manual .<br />height and weight were used to calculate bmi , which was categorised using the who criteria .<br />systolic and diastolic blood pressure was measured after rest in recumbent men using a sphygmomanometer .<br />physical working capacity was assessed using the cycle ergonometric test .<br />after a normal resting electrocardiogram ,<br />5  min of submaximal exercise was performed at different work rates depending on body mass , directly followed by a maximal test with gradually increasing load until volitional exhaustion , or an estimate was derived from a nomogram for men who did not complete the full duration .<br />the cognitive test was a written assessment and comprised four domains : linguistic understanding , spatial recognition , general knowledge and ability to follow mechanical instructions : the results were transformed into a single score with a value ranging from 1 to 9 .<br />from the medical assessment at conscription , we identified diagnoses , and we used the international classification of diseases eighth revision , icd-8 , icd-8 codes 393458 to indicate diagnosis of any cardiovascular disease at the time of conscription . using the swedish national inpatient register15 exlude and the cause of death register,20 we identified the dates of first fatal and non -

fatal and fatal stroke were examined together and separately .<br />in the analyses of aetiological subtypes ( ischaemic and intracerebral haemorrhagic stroke ) , first event by each subtype was used .<br />associations were examined using an unadjusted ( model 1 ) and three further adjusted models .<br />in model 2 , adjustment was for demographic and socioeconomic factors for the family of origin : birth year , geographical region , parents socioeconomic index , and household crowding .<br />model 3 was additionally adjusted for characteristics in adolescence : cognitive function ( continuous ) , systolic and diastolic blood pressure ( continuous ) , and cardiovascular disease at conscription .<br />in model 4<br />lifestyle factors in adolescence ( here represented by physical fitness and body mass ) were also added to the model : bmi ( in 4 categories ) and physical working capacity score ( continuous ) .<br />the proportional hazards assumption for stress resilience in relation to stroke was tested graphically , as well as using a test based on schoenfeld residuals , and no evidence was found that it was violated .<br />as this was assessed using age as the underlying time scale , it indicates that the association between stress resilience and stroke was constant and did not diminish with increasing age .<br />the study cohort consists of male swedish residents born between 1952 and 1956 , who were eligible for military conscription and included in the swedish military conscription register.13 at this time , conscription and the associated examinations were mandatory for all male citizens of the appropriate age ( 18 and 19  years , with a small number at later ages ) .<br />during the years covered by this study , only men with significant disability or a severe chronic disease were exempted from conscription ( approximately 23% annually).14 the assessments included extensive and highly standardised physical and psychological examinations by physicians and psychologists .<br />stroke risk was assessed from 1987 ( when the swedish national inpatient register15 attained full coverage ) to 2010 .<br />from among a total of 284  198 men<br />identified , we excluded 2564 subjects with unreliable data such as errors in the personal identification number or uncertain vital status .<br />those with implausible values for height ( less than 144  cm ) , weight ( above 178  kg ) , body mass index , bmi , ( below 15 ) , systolic blood pressure ( below 50 or above 230  mm  hg ) and diastolic blood pressure ( below 30 or above 135  mm  hg ) , were also excluded from the analysis ; in total 225 men.16 after excluding individuals who emigrated , died , or had a diagnosis of stroke before study entry in 1987 , the sample comprised 271  767 men .<br />men with missing data for stress resilience , potential confounding factors ( year of birth , geographic region , systolic and diastolic blood pressure , bmi , cognitive function , physical working capacity , parental socioeconomic index and household crowding ) were also excluded ( 37  196 men ; including 722 men with a stroke diagnosis at some time ) .<br />the sample available for the main analysis comprised 237  879 men , 84% of the potential target population .<br />the men underwent a psychological examination to assess their potential ability to cope with war -

fatal and fatal stroke were examined together and separately .<br />in the analyses of aetiological subtypes ( ischaemic and intracerebral haemorrhagic stroke ) , first event by each subtype was used .<br />associations were examined using an unadjusted ( model 1 ) and three further adjusted models .<br />in model 2 , adjustment was for demographic and socioeconomic factors for the family of origin : birth year , geographical region , parents socioeconomic index , and household crowding .<br />model 3 was additionally adjusted for characteristics in adolescence : cognitive function ( continuous ) , systolic and diastolic blood pressure ( continuous ) , and cardiovascular disease at conscription .<br />in model 4<br />lifestyle factors in adolescence ( here represented by physical fitness and body mass ) were also added to the model : bmi ( in 4 categories ) and physical working capacity score ( continuous ) .<br />the proportional hazards assumption for stress resilience in relation to stroke was tested graphically , as well as using a test based on schoenfeld residuals , and no evidence was found that it was violated .<br />as this was assessed using age as the underlying time scale , it indicates that the association between stress resilience and stroke was constant and did not diminish with increasing age .<br />all analyses are based on the 237  879 conscripts with complete information for the required variables , after exclusion of individuals who emigrated , died , or had a diagnosis of stroke before the beginning of follow - up in 1987 .<br />during the follow - up period of 19872010 ,<br />3411 men ( 1.4% ) received an inpatient diagnosis of stroke ( or stroke was recorded as the underlying cause of death ) .<br />the stroke incidence rate was 64 per 100  000 person - years in our study population , compared with 101 per 100  000 person - years in the excluded subset with missing data on covariates .<br />men with low resilience tended to have lower physical capacity , lower cognitive function scores , higher blood pressure , were underweight , overweight or obese , more often had a diagnosis of cardiovascular disease at conscription , and had parents with a lower socioeconomic index and experienced greater household crowding in childhood .<br />population ( n=237  879 ) characteristics by stress resilience levels cvd , cardiovascular disease ; sei , socioeconomic index .<br />the associations with stroke for stress resilience and the other measures are reported in table 2 .<br />the lowest stress resilience group ( 21.8% with scores 13 ) compared with the highest ( 23.7% with score 79 ) was associated with increased risk of all stroke types .<br />the intermediate category of stress resilience lay between the low and high groups , indicating a graded association .<br />when adjusted for the demographic and socioeconomic factors in childhood , the association attenuated slightly but remained statistically significant .<br />additional adjustment for health and development characteristics in adolescence<br />further adjustment for physical fitness indicated by bmi and physical capacity had the most notable impact on the hrs , but despite the reduction in magnitude , statistical significance remained .<br />blood pressure was modelled as continuous variables to ensure the most effective adjustment : the magnitude of the associations appears small as the hrs are for each unit change per mm  hg , but statistical significance for associations with stroke remained after adjustment for all other measures .<br />/ material background factors ( birth year , region , parental sei and household crowding ) .<br />model 3 . adjusted for 2 + characteristics in adolescence ( cognitive function , diastolic and systolic blood pressure and cvd diagnosis at conscription ) .<br />model 4 . adjusted for 2 + 3 + physical fitness in adolescence ( physical working capacity and bmi ) .<br />table  3 presents the outcomes for the stroke subgroups , fatal ( n=308 ) , ischaemic ( n=2060 ) and intracerebral haemorrhagic ( n=676 ) stroke .<br />all showed a significant association with stress resilience , with higher magnitude associations for fatal than non - fatal stroke ; and for haemorrhagic than ischaemic stroke .<br />in adjusted models , a similar pattern as for all stroke appeared , but the association of stress resilience and ischaemic stroke was more notably attenuated by adjustment for bmi and physical capacity .<br />stress resilience and stroke subdivided by stroke characteristics model 2 . adjusted for socio / material background factors ( birth year , region , parents sei , household crowding ) .<br />model 3 . adjusted for 2 + characteristics in adolescence ( cognition , systolic and diastolic blood pressure , cvd diagnosis at conscription ) .<br />model 4 . adjusted for 2 + 3+physical fitness in adolescence ( physical working capacity and bmi ) .<br />low stress resilience in adolescence was associated with a higher risk of stroke in men of working age between 31 years and 58  years , a relatively young age group to experience stroke .<br />this association was independent of childhood socioeconomic circumstances , as well as health and developmental characteristics in adolescence .<br />the association was attenuated more notably ( but not eliminated ) by adjustment for bmi and physical working capacity as indicators of physical fitness in adolescence , likely to signal future lifestyle characteristics .<br />our results from a general population - based cohort of men are consistent with recent studies suggesting a role for psychosocial stress in influencing stroke risk.35 <br /> 9 <br /> 10 similarly , poorer adaptation to social adversity  possibly signalling lower stress resilience  has also been linked with an increased risk of stroke.22 stress resilience in adolescence does not measure exposure to stress but does indicate susceptibility , such that the adversities of daily life may have a greater impact and conspire to produce a more chronic pattern stress arousal over adult life .<br />another study has found associations with stress independent of lifestyle factors.4 this difference with our findings may be due to methodological variations , as we have a measure of resilience rather than stress exposure , it was collected prospectively , many years before stroke , and we adjusted for some characteristics in adolescence that may themselves be consequences of low stress resilience , as discussed below .<br />we hypothesise that low resilience to psychosocial stress could indicate exposure to psychosocial stress in earlier life , resulting in poorer control of the stress response that can continue across the life course .<br />animal studies have demonstrated that early life stress can alter hpa axis function in a way that can persist over the life course , producing persistent low resilience to stress.23<br />24 stress resilience may also be a characteristic of personality type , and thus , a persistent trait .<br />for example , low resilience may reflect something like type a behaviour which , although controversial , has previously been related to increased cardiovascular risk.25<br />it has been demonstrated that adverse socioeconomic conditions in childhood increase stroke risk26 ; so we adjusted for such factors , with little impact on the association of stress resilience with stroke .<br />markers of early life exposure to stress have been linked with poorer cognitive development27 and higher blood pressure.28 thus , cognitive function and blood pressure may represent consequences of earlier stressful exposures and poorer stress resilience , and adjusting for these factors may have produced conservative estimates of association ; arguably an over - adjustment .<br />markers of stressful exposures in early life are also linked with unhealthy weight gain,29 which may influence physical exercise or be a consequence of low exercise levels.30 thus , even in adolescence , bmi and fitness could , in part , be a consequence of lower stress resilience and earlier stressful exposures .<br />we believe the results suggest that a significant proportion of the association of stress and stress resilience with stroke risk is due to lifestyle risk factors .<br />this is consistent with recent findings from a british cohort study with older participants , where the association of psychological distress with cvd risk was largely explained by behavioural / lifestyle processes.31 our findings suggest such processes have a long natural history , beginning in childhood or adolescence .<br />our results were consistent among the different stroke subtypes ( fatal , non - fatal , ischaemic and intracerebral haemorrhagic stroke ) although there may be pathological heterogeneity .<br />previous studies investigating the association between psychosocial stress and stroke subtypes are few , but the results are mostly consistent with our findings suggesting a more notable association for fatal than for non - fatal stroke , and for haemorrhagic than ischaemic stroke<br />.<br />the stronger association with haemorrhagic than ischaemic stroke could also be a consequence of a greater aetiological heterogeneity in ischaemic stroke .<br />physical working capacity and bmi in adolescence most notably attenuated that association of stress resilience with ischaemic stroke , suggesting more significant mediation through lifestyle factors .<br />as this is a study of stress resilience measured in adolescence , it is possible that stressful exposures in adult life might represent a higher risk of stroke , particularly chronic exposures among the less stress resilient .<br />overweight , obesity and poorer physical capacity in adolescence are likely to signal an accumulation of behavioural / lifestyle health risks that continue through adulthood.32<br />33 other lifestyle risks in the years between conscription and stroke , such as smoking , alcohol and diet , are also likely to be relevant mediating factors .<br />further mediating factors might include type 2 diabetes , a stroke risk which tends to have its onset in adulthood some years after the time of conscription , which has also been linked with psychosocial stress.34 <br /> 35 as behaviours and diagnoses occurring between conscription and stroke are intermediate in the causal pathway , we have not included them in the model .<br />unfortunately , we have no data on smoking , diet or alcohol consumption , which could have added further to our understanding of lifestyle risks .<br />thus , major mediation between poor stress resilience and stroke risk may be through lifestyle factors and fitness , suggesting interventions for psychosocial stress and behaviour might be most effective in lowering stoke risk among younger men .<br />the use of prospectively recorded data from several linked registers , and the long - term follow - up subsequent to the measure of susceptibility , increases the validity and reliability of the study , as well as avoiding bias due to reverse causation or poor recall .<br />the study population is largely representative of the male general population as only a small proportion of swedish men were exempted from enlistment examinations .<br />extensive physical and psychological examinations were conducted in adolescence , so the information was objectively measured and were able to adjust for a variety of powerful stroke risk factors including , bmi and physical capacity which are objective physiological measures .<br />the duration between conscription examination and start of follow - up means it is unlikely that prodromal characteristics of an impending stroke were driving the stress resilience measure , and it was possible to identify pre - existing cardiovascular diagnoses and adjust for blood pressure .<br />the potential limitations of the study include the inclusion of only men , as women also suffer from stroke .<br />this was necessary as the measure of stress susceptibility was collected during military conscription , which at the time was almost exclusively available to men .<br />as stress resilience<br />was only measured once , we can not be definitive about stability of this characteristic over time and how this may interact with stressful exposures . in these data ,<br />the association of stress resilience with stroke risk did not vary by age , indicating that this measure of stress resilience is a relatively stable characteristic over time , at least in terms of stroke risk .<br />there is a possibility of misclassification of the stress resilience measure if potential conscripts attempted to obtain exemption from military service through<br />false answers , if they exist , would most likely dilute the resilience measure and result in less precise estimates .<br />the temporal relationship of stress resilience and physical fitness in adolescence can not be established , but we hypothesise that poor stress resilience has an adverse influence on physical fitness .<br />as stressful exposures were not examined , it is possible that the magnitude of associations with stress resilience is conservative<br />.<br />a proportion of the cardiovascular diagnoses at conscription when the men in our cohort were 1819 years old may not be directly relevant to stroke risk .<br />we included this information in the models to ensure that poorer stress resilience was not a function of pre - existing cardiovascular disease , where a proportion of these diseases may increase subsequent stroke risk .<br />most stroke onset occurs at a higher age than in our study , so early stroke may be somewhat atypical and the aetiology may differ from stroke at older ages.36 however , stroke incidence in younger adults ( younger than 55  years of age ) is increasing.37 stroke at young ( working ) age is a particular concern , as a reduction of working capacity increases the personal , social as well as economic burden of the disease .<br />this is of public health significance , as stroke at early ages has the potential for greater lifetime burden of disability , and because some risks may be modifiable .<br />the proportion of stroke diagnoses in the analytic sample is lower than among those who were not included .<br />this is for two reasons , and the first is that men who had a stroke at an early age , close in time to the conscription examination , were excluded deliberately to avoid associations due to reverse causation .<br />some men in poor health , with very low levels of physical fitness , or low cognitive function at the time of the conscription examination , were identified as unsuitable for military service by the assessors and may not have completed all the examinations ( including for stress resilience ) .<br />as these men  excluded due to missing values on the assessments  may have the greatest risk of stroke , we may have underestimated the proportion at risk and conceivably produced a conservative estimate of stroke risk .<br />the validity of some diagnoses recorded in the swedish national inpatient register can be questionable , but the reliability of stroke diagnoses is satisfactory.38 <br /> 39<br />the use of prospectively recorded data from several linked registers , and the long -

distance truck driver not living in the same village , and directly touched the blood flowing from the deceased patient s mouth and nose when he cried on the corpse .<br />case 4 , the older son of the index patient , was also a long - distance truck driver , and took care of the dead body and was wiping off the blood from the face of the corpse .<br />case 5 , a local mortuary beautician , did the make - up for the corpse with gloves and mask , but took them off twice during the procedure .<br />the above 5 cases all developed the disease 715 days after exposure , with only 3 of them having contact with blood after death .<br />in comparison with the index patient<br />, all 5 secondary cases had minor clinical features ( table 1 ) , without obvious hemorrhagic manifestations , so they did not receive dexamethasone therapy .<br />except for the major risk factor of blood contact , droplet contact ( n  =  4 ) , which included 3 medical staff who were involved in the intubation and the index patient s daughter who cared for him before death ,<br />in addition , the risk factor of possible airborne transmission ( being in the icu room or funeral room without mask protection ) was also assessed among all 63 exposed individuals . of them , the medical doctors and nurses ( n  =  16 ) were with protection ; and the others were without ( n  =  47 ) , including icu patients who were staying in the same room ( n<br />=  8) , family members (<br />n  =  3 ) , and visitors to the funeral room where the corpse was kept ( n  =  35 ) .<br />the multivariate analysis ( logistic regression analysis ) showed that blood contact was the most likely mode of transmission ( p  <  .001 ; table 1 ) .<br />it is noticeable that the serum collected from the index patient on the day he died contained a relatively high amount of sftsv , which reached about 3.55    10 viral rna copies / ml ( calculated as 9.67    10 50% tissue culture infective dose [ tcid50]/ml ) .<br />this number was about 100  000-fold higher than viral copies detected in the serum samples of the 5 secondary patients , which ranged from 10 to 10 copies / ml ( table 1 ) .<br />all 5 patients had virus - specific igm antibodies in the acute phase , and elevated virus - specific immunoglobin g ( igg ) antibodies in the convalescent phase .<br />the index patient , however , had minimal or undetectable levels of virus specific igm antibodies on day 11 after onset of fever ( table 1 ) .<br />compared with the entire genomic sequence of the virus strain isolated from the index patient ,<br />cases 2 and 3 were nearly 100% identical , and provided genetic evidence for the epidemic findings on the possible transmission of sftsv from the index patient to secondary patients .<br />here , we reported the person - to - person transmission of sftsv with a cluster of 6 sfts patients that occurred in shandong province of eastern china .<br />investigation studies revealed that all 5 secondary infected patients had possible contact with the index patient s blood .<br />of them , only case 1 ( icu doctor ) had evidence of droplet contact contamination ( during intubation ) but not blood contact , but we included him also as a blood contactor because he performed intubation without protective face shield and goggles , therefore he had an extremely high risk of blood contact through unprotected skin and mucosa .<br />the risk assessment revealed that blood contact was the major risk factor for the human - to - human transmission of sftsv .<br />additionally , 3 secondary patients who only had contact with the index patient after death were still infected , which indicated that sftsv - infected blood may remain infectious for a long time , even after patient death .<br />it is notable that the level of virus copies in the index patient s serum was extremely high , but with no detectable igm or igg antibodies , which suggested that his immune responses to limit the replication of sftsv were severely impaired .<br />the patient had no immune system disease , thus the minimal immune responses might be due to the early and sustained application of glucocorticoid , which has a side effect of repressing immune functions ; clinical physicians should take note of this finding .<br />clinically , sfts is easily confused with hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome caused by hantavirus   and human anaplasmosis .<br />the hantavirus - specific igm antibodies were not detected in the sfts patients serum samples ( data not show ) .<br />due to the limitation of our study , we were not able to detect rickettsia infection , which was previously reported in outbreaks of nosocomial infections<br />.<br />however , the methods we used for diagnosis of sfts patients were well validated , and the human - to - human transmission of sftsv we described in this study could not simply be classified as being nosocomial transmission ; specially , 3 of the 5 secondary cases that occurred in the household .<br />additionally , the lessons of person - to - person transmission of sftsv we learned from this study highlighted the necessity of establishing standard precautions for avoiding direct contact and blood - based transmission .<br />this work was supported by the china mega -

test in order to assure not to be any significant differences between two groups .<br />after the execution of above mentioned method ( about 14 weeks ) , the academic achievement post - test , and performance test and attitude toward tests ( saas - r ) were performed .<br />moreover , 2 months after post - test , it was replicated to measure the rate of memorization .<br />in order to analyze data the statistical method , the dependent and independent t- tests were used to determine mean differences of two groups and k2 test was applied to assign the differences of two groups attitude toward tests .<br />hypothesis 1 : the rate of students performance learning in authentic assessments is more than the traditional ones .<br />as the calculated ( t=4/527 ) in confidence level of 99% ( a=0/01 ) and ( df=29 ) is more than tc(=2/756 ) , the null hypothesis is rejected and the research hypothesis is approved .<br />it means that there is significant difference between the rate of students performance learning in authentic assessment and traditional assessment .<br />the mean of authentic assessment is bigger , so the rate of students performance learning in authentic assessment is more .<br />t - test statistics to determine the discrepancy of performance learning in authentic & traditional assessment .<br />hypothesis 2 : the rate of post - test scores is more in authentic assessment in comparison with traditional one  as the calculated ( t=1.29 ) in confidence level of % 95 ( a=0.05 ) and ( df=58 ) is less than tc ( = 2 ) , the null hypothesis is approved and alternative one is rejected .<br />it implies that there was no significant difference between two groups post -

academic .<br />they evaluate the school goals more internalized and meet more self - regulation and motivation .<br />the results are similar to the findings of ( 13 , 14 , 17 , 18 ) .<br />considering the results of this research , some suggestions are as follow :<br />* most teachers are familiar with traditional assessments methods but they do nt have systematic and enough knowledge with authentic and new assessment methods .<br />so it is suggested to be presented the teachers necessary awareness and knowledge about these kinds of assessments through the co -

for - service beneficiaries with chronic illnesses .<br />these 3-year demonstration projects were awarded to eight companies , with the first programs becoming operational in august 2005 , and the eighth and final program becoming operational in january 2006 .<br />the pilots follow a randomized - controlled design and require that vendors reimburse the medicare program in full if they are unable to achieve budget neutrality ( inclusive of vendor fees ) .<br />while official results of phase i are not due for over a year , three vendors have withdrawn early ( lifemasters , mckesson , and cigna as subcontractor to healthways ) and , in the preliminary evaluation of the first 6 months , the remaining projects have failed to achieve medical cost savings in excess of vendor fees ( mccall , cromwell , and bernard , 2007 ) .<br />these early results lend support to a growing body of literature concluding that commercial dm programs do not generate medical cost savings.the u.s .<br />congressional budget office ( 2004 )<br />review of the dm literature concluded that   there is insufficient evidence to conclude that disease management programs can generally reduce the overall cost of health care services .<br />the most recent review by mattke and colleagues , which included 317 individual studies , reported that <br /> when the costs of the intervention were appropriately accounted for and subtracted from any savings , there was no conclusive evidence that disease management leads to a net reduction of direct medical costs .<br />at the end of phase i , cms will face the decision of whether to expand mhs to a second phase .<br />if the early trends are indicative of the final phase i results , policymakers should consider the changes that must be made to the commercial dm model to improve the likelihood of achieving cost savings and then assess whether the model is sufficiently compelling , when compared to other chronic care management strategies , to justify pursuing it .<br />this article contributes to this process by describing the characteristics of the current commercial dm model that limit its ability to attain short - term medical cost savings and then discussing the changes required to overcome them .<br />prior to the initiation of a dm program , three questions should be answered to inform dm program design and set realistic expectations for the outcomes that will be realized : ( 1 ) what is the timeframe over which medical cost savings are expected to be achieved ?<br />( 2 ) given this timeframe , which categories of medical costs have the potential to be reduced ?<br />( 3 ) is there sufficient opportunity in a given population to achieve this targeted reduction in medical costs ?<br />the current commercial dm model suffers from a mismatch between the expectation of a short - run return on investment and an intervention that targets medium to long - term medical cost savings .<br />thus , the first step toward fixing the current dm model is to develop an internally consistent approach .<br />the answer to the first question should be guided by the financial requirements of the stakeholder seeking to pursue dm for their population .<br />although savings can be realized in the short , medium , and long term from altering the course of disease progression , most payers seek a short - term return on their investments .<br />for - profit organizations strive to maximize shareholder value and , along with nonprofit organizations , are hesitant to invest in long - term interventions when their population has significant turnover and they are not confident that the program will reduce medical costs .<br />the 3-year timeframe of the first phase of mhs reflects this focus on short - term medical cost savings . in the short term<br />, reductions may be more easily achieved for certain types of costs incurred by chronically ill populations .<br />in the commercially insured , medicare and medicaid populations ,<br />the single largest health expenditure is in patient utilization ( nearly 33 percent in 2005 ) with 13.3 percent of all emergency department visits associated with a hospital admission ( mccaig and newar , 2006 ) .<br />diagnoses for which timely and effective outpatient care reduces the risk of hospitalization ( billings et al . , 1993 ) .<br />the second and third largest health expenditures , physician and clinical services and prescription drugs , typically increase as part of successful interventions targeting chronic illness ( u.s .<br />congressional budget office , 2004 ; linden , 2006 ; ofman et al .<br />.<br />therefore , the primary opportunity for commercial dm programs to realize short - term medical cost savings is via reductions in costly avoidable hospitalizations and the emergency department visits that often lead to them ( linden , 2006 ) .<br />further , a focus on avoiding the first admission during the intervention period is critical given that hospitalizations for chronic illnesses are relatively rare events and individuals may only experience one hospitalization over the entire course of a program .<br />if the first admission is missed , the dm program may not have another opportunity to reduce the participant 's medical costs .<br />before initiating a dm program in a given population ,<br />a numbers needed to decrease ( nnd ) analysis should be conducted to assess whether there is sufficient opportunity for an intervention to achieve medical cost savings .<br />an nnd factors in variables including population - specific hospitalization rates , average cost per hospitalization , and the fees that will be charged by the vendor to project the percent of hospital admissions that need to be prevented to achieve a given savings target .<br />two recent studies using this analysis ( linden , 2006 ; linden and biuso , 2006 ) calculated that between 11 and 74 percent of hospitalizations needed to be reduced for a dm program to break even on fees .<br />an nnd for the mhs projects estimates a 15-percent reduction in all cause hospitalizations and an 82-percent reduction in disease - specific admissions ( congestive heart failure and diabetes ) to break even on fees alone ( table 1 ) .<br />an nnd also informs the size of the population that should be included in a dm intervention and the fees that should be paid to vendors .<br />the disease - specific hospitalization rate and<br />the percent of hospitalizations required to break even will vary in relation to the disease severity of the population ; in a sicker population with a higher attendant admissions rate , a lower percent of hospitalizations will need to be decreased to break even .<br />however , a narrowly focused program targeting only the sickest patients addresses only a small fraction of the total disease burden and is unlikely to achieve the goals of dm at the population level .<br />to determine a reasonable fee schedule<br />, the percent of hospitalizations the vendor expects to decrease in the specific population should be estimated and then , given the client 's average cost of a hospitalization , fees should be set below the expected savings .<br />under these two considerations , both dm vendors and their clients<br />are best served by a program that is able to reduce the greatest percent of hospitalizations in the largest chronically ill population .<br />to achieve this ,<br />each of the three components of the typical commercial dm model must be successfully executed .<br />first , individuals within the target population at risk for a near - term hospitalization must be accurately identified .<br />second , they must be enrolled and actively participate in the program for a meaningful period of time .<br />third , the program must include interventions that modify or close deficits in participant and/or provider behavior ( i.e. , self - care and care - seeking behaviors and medical treatment or management ) that lead to near - term hospital admissions .<br />as currently structured , the commercial dm model is not optimally executing any of the three components .<br />the typical approach , the barriers to realizing short - term cost savings , and recommendations to address the shortcomings are discussed for each component in the following section and summarized in table 2 .<br />dm programs typically use medical claims to identify patients with a specific chronic condition who were hospitalized in the prior year and then target them to receive an intensive intervention of regularly scheduled outbound calls from clinical staff .<br />participants with no medical claims for a hospitalization or emergency department visit in the prior year are classified as low risk and typically receive only quarterly mailings .<br />a recent study conducted in a large managed care population reveals the problem with this approach ( linden and goldberg , 2007 ) .<br />members hospitalized for a chronic illness in a given year were categorized by prior year hospitalization status .<br />the claims - based identification and stratification methodology , identical to that typically employed by dm companies , showed that only 6.4 percent of patients hospitalized in the current year had been hospitalized in the prior year .<br />thus , the vast majority of current year hospitalizations came from members who would have been misclassified by a dm company as low risk , unidentified due to lack of claims data , or newly enrolled in the health plan .<br />had these members been enrolled in a dm program that targeted only high risk patients based on prior hospitalizations they would have received either a minimal intervention or no intervention at all , making it highly improbable that the program could have prevented their hospitalizations .<br />dm programs are increasingly using predictive modeling to improve claims - based identification of individuals at risk for high medical costs .<br />these statistical models use past medical claims and other basic demographic data to predict future costs .<br />however , it requires past claims history in order to achieve any reasonable degree of accuracy , and it still fails to incorporate many factors that explain health care utilization that are not reflected in administrative data , such as predisposing and enabling factors and perceived need .<br />a recent study comparing the accuracy of several commercial models to predict high - cost participants based on their past claims history found that all models significantly underpredicted high - cost individuals and overpredicted low - cost individuals ( winkelman and mehmud , 2007 ) .<br />the best fitting model underpredicted costs by 73 percent in the highest cost percentile ( 99 - 100 ) and underpredicted costs by 52 percent in the 96 - 99th percentile of costs .<br />these models fared worse when no past claims history was available and therefore would be uninformative for new entrants to a population .<br />given the importance for dm programs to prospectively identify individuals who will incur high costs in the near future , such low predictive ability can lead dm vendors to miss the patients most likely to have an acute episode in the near term .<br />in light of these shortcomings , dm programs should look beyond claims data to other sources of patient data .<br />psychometrically validated health risk assessments ( hras ) developed to predict future hospitalizations should be used in conjunction with claims - based models and they offer a compelling alternative when no claims history is available .<br />several instruments have been developed specifically for the senior population ( boult et al . , 1993 ) and achieve reasonably good predictive accuracy ; the sensitivity - specificity tradeoff measured by an area under the curve is consistently around 70 percent ( wagner et al . , 2006 ) .<br />at program initiation these surveys can be distributed at the population level to improve identification , and then readministered quarterly to find incident cases as well as track changes in risk status of previously surveyed participants .<br />many dm programs have such tools available but use them on a very limited basis ; thus , increasing their use would not require a fundamental overhaul of the identification approach and , if administered electronically , would minimize the incremental cost .<br />there are two other potential approaches to identify patients at risk for a near - term hospitalization .<br />a direct referral from the patient 's physician is the most accurate means of identifying suitable candidates for a dm program .<br />despite the fact that many dm programs have a channel for such direct referrals , physicians rarely use them .<br />physicians may not be aware of patient eligibility for dm or may not support the program .<br />the broader issue of how to engage physicians in dm is discussed at the end of this section .<br />electronic medical records ( emr ) and other repositories of clinical data that include medication lists and laboratory values are rich sources of up - to - date patient information .<br />health systems such as kaiser permanente rely heavily on their emr for such purposes ( hyatt , taylor , and budge , 2004 ) , but outside of integrated delivery systems , third - party access to emr data would have to be negotiated .<br />thus , while both of these strategies are promising , under the current health care delivery system supplementing claims - based identification with hras is the most compelling approach to improve identification of high risk patients .<br />this process is labor intensive and time consuming , limiting the number of eligible persons that can be contacted in a timely fashion .<br />further , people are often wary of discussing health - related issues with strangers over the telephone and potential participants must be convinced that the program is legitimate . in commercial dm programs ,<br />enrollment rates are quite low and vary by disease , with asthma program enrollment rates averaging 10 percent and congestive heart failure program enrollment rates averaging 30 percent of the eligible population ( lewis , 2007 ) .<br />vendors in the mhs project are strongly incentivized to maximize enrollment within the required opt - in approach and have achieved high enrollment rates in the first 6 months of the mhs projects ranging from 65 to 92.3 percent ( mccall , cromwell , and bernard , 2007 ) .<br />however , mean time - to - agreement ranged from 37 to 100 days , revealing that in the best case it took over a month to enroll beneficiaries in the program .<br />further , those agreeing to participate were considerably healthier compared to non - participants , indicating that the beneficiaries who could most benefit from dm require even greater effort to enroll .<br />an hra is also helpful in the enrollment process as it identifies individuals who are ready to consider changing their health behaviors and as a result are more likely to enroll in the program .<br />the percentage of individuals in any given population that are ready to change their behavior is not easily quantified as it is highly dependent on how readiness to change is defined and differs by the particular behaviors that are targeted .<br />most survey instruments include questions based on prochaska 's ( 1979 ) stages of change psychosocial model for determining the level of readiness to change .<br />participants who are at least contemplating change , once identified , should be contacted by program representatives trained in behavior change methods , such as motivational interviewing .<br />such techniques help participants overcome ambivalence and increase likelihood of enrollment ( miller and rollnick , 1991 ) .<br />representatives who are not trained in these methods may be too directive or confrontational , which can reverse a prior commitment to change ( amrhein et al . , 2003 ) and discourage participation .<br />given the expense associated with telephonic enrollment , programs implemented in large populations should consider the use of interactive voice recognition ( ivr ) or web - enabled technologies to maximize the outreach to eligible participants .<br />a tradeoff exists between the narrow - and - deep telephonic approach and the wide - and - shallow approach that ivr technologies facilitate .<br />an optimal enrollment model would include a technologically - based outreach process that draws on motivational interviewing methods .<br />however , this combination is not currently mature enough to be widely available .<br />thus , the choice of approach should be driven by the broader decision on the size of the population targeted to receive the intervention .<br />for example , one employer - based program achieved a 90-percent hra response rate when a $ 500 rebate on medical premiums was offered , compared to a 20-percent response rate with no incentive ( finkelstein and kosa , 2003 ) .<br />a recent study demonstrated that even modest incentives were effective in motivating overweight employees to lose weight .<br />after 3 months , individuals who received $ 14 for their participation lost 4.7 pounds on average compared to only 2 pounds in the control group ( finkelstein et al . , 2007 ) .<br />physician incentives can further bolster enrollment by sharing the cost savings associated with the program or by providing a pay - for - performance initiative in which they are paid for enrolling and supporting their patients in the program .<br />while incentives increase program costs , at the right level they may be offset by a concomitant increase in enrollment and active engagement assuming that the sub sequent intervention reduces medical costs .<br />for participants classified as high risk , most commercial dm programs share a common intervention approach focused on improving process measures ( e.g. , increasing regular testing of glycosylated hemoglobin [ hba1c ] in diabetics ) in order to avoid costly complications in the future .<br />since most process measures are performed periodically ( i.e. , diabetics should receive an hba1c test between two and four times per year ) , the core dm intervention is comprised of patient calls around the time that these tests should occur .<br />a recent study conducted by healthways , inc .<br />reported that program participants with diabetes ( 245,668 unique members with diabetes from 25 different health plans across the united states ) received no more than four calls in their first 12 months of the program ( coberley et al . , 2007 ) .<br />while periodic calls to participants have proven adequate to elicit improvements in screening rates ( coberley et al . , 2007 ) , they are insufficient to pick up on signs that patients are at risk for a near - term emergency department visit or hospitalization .<br />further , there is evidence to suggest that most clinical practice guidelines for chronic illnesses are not modified to consider the needs of older patients with multiple and complex comorbidities ( boyd et al . , 2005 ) .<br />thus , it is possible that this emphasis on adherence to practice guidelines focuses on the wrong aspects of care for this population and may have a detrimental effect on outcomes .<br />several interventions have been shown to be successful at reducing avoidable admissions , but they require a greater frequency of patient contact than is currently the norm .<br />most participants at highest risk of a near - term hospitalization need to be assessed daily .<br />one strategy is to use outbound calls conducted by individuals proficient in behavior change methodologies .<br />remote telemonitoring ( rtm ) technology offers an alternative strategy for assessing patient status and is typically less costly than daily outbound calls .<br />via rtm ,<br />the signs or symptoms of an impending acute exacerbation triggers an alert to a nurse who can respond immediately and triage the patient to the appropriate ambulatory care setting .<br />for example , daily monitoring of congestive heart failure patients catches symptoms including weight gain , lower extremity edema , and increasing dyspnea that are typically present in the 8 to 12 days prior to hospitalization ( schiff et al . ,<br />a recent systematic review of rtm reported that , in the majority of studies of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cardiac diseases , rtm led to significant decreases in hospitalizations , emergency department visits , and length of stay ; studies of diabetes and hypertension had mixed results ( pare , jaana , and sicotte , 2007 ) .<br />however , rtm is expensive and , in diabetes , it is estimated to cost between $ 300 and $ 400 per patient per year when sponsored by a physician practice ( adler - milstein<br />et<br />al . , 2007 ) .<br />other interventions shown to reduce near - term avoidable admissions include the provision of seasonal influenza vaccinations ( nichol , baken , and nelson , 1999 ) and a monthly pharmacist review of a patient 's medication profile ( hepler and strand , 1990 ) .<br />the latter may substantially reduce avoidable hospitalizations caused by drug - related problems such as untreated indications , use of the medication without indication , improper drug selection , subtherapeutic dosage , overdose , adverse re actions , interactions , and failure to receive the drug ( strand , morley , and cipolle , 1990 ) .<br />one of the biggest challenges in commercial dm is engaging physicians to support the program .<br />these programs have little ability to collaborate with physicians , many of whom are skeptical of dm initiatives and view them as disruptive to the physician - patient relationship ( leider , 1999 ) .<br />without explicit endorsement from their physician<br />, many patients will not enroll or adhere to the intervention provided by the dm program ( leider , 1999 ) .<br />this is problematic as physicians are well positioned to identify potential participants and persuade them to participate in a dm program .<br />further , when physicians are actively involved in the intervention process , it is more likely that a dm program will be able to effectuate sufficient change in a patient 's clinical condition to avoid an acute exacerbation .<br />a recent article on the role of physicians in dm reports several barriers to physician engagement including a lack of financial incentive , a lack of technology to facilitate communication , and the need for a trusted practice - based program champion ( kuraitis , 2007 ) .<br />leider ( 1999 ) suggests five core strategies to achieve physician buy - in for disease management programs .<br />these include ( 1 ) educating physicians on the goals of the dm program , ( 2 ) identifying champions with positive views of the program , ( 3 ) setting clear goals and expectations for physicians who participate in the program , ( 4 ) demonstrating that a relatively easy program works before attempting a more complex or controversial program , and ( 5 ) sharing the gains by rewarding physicians for their time and effort supporting the program .<br />while such strategies are likely to strengthen physician support of commercial dm , they raise the broader question of the appropriate role for each player in supporting chronic dm .<br />some view commercial dm companies as filling a gap in our acute care focused delivery system that has consistently failed to deliver high - quality care to those with chronic illnesses .<br />however , the flaws of a third - party work - around are evident in the increased fragmentation of care that results from a lack of coordination between dm vendors and traditional care delivery settings .<br />a compelling alternative is wagner 's chronic care model that includes a primary care - based medical home<br />.<br />proponents of this model believe that the primary care team is the entity best suited to deliver chronic care management ( geyman , 2007 ) .<br />in this model<br />, the primary care physician leads a team of specialists , nurses , dieticians , pharmacists , and health educators to provide and coordinate all the care for a chronically ill population .<br />with evidence of cost reduction and quality improvement from group health cooperative and kaiser permanente , primary case - based dm enjoys empirical support ( mcculloch et al . , 2000 ) .<br />recent pay - for - performance programs that attempt to align payment incentives with high - quality chronic care also reflect a belief that chronic care is the responsibility of physicians and the systems in which they operate ( rosenthal et al . , 2007 ) .<br />dm programs typically use medical claims to identify patients with a specific chronic condition who were hospitalized in the prior year and then target them to receive an intensive intervention of regularly scheduled outbound calls from clinical staff .<br />participants with no medical claims for a hospitalization or emergency department visit in the prior year are classified as low risk and typically receive only quarterly mailings .<br />a recent study conducted in a large managed care population reveals the problem with this approach ( linden and goldberg , 2007 ) .<br />members hospitalized for a chronic illness in a given year were categorized by prior year hospitalization status .<br />the claims -

term medical cost savings that can be achieved .<br />by relying on claims data<br />, individuals at risk for a near - term hospitalization can not be accurately identified .<br />behavior change specialists and physicians are not actively engaged to support recruitment and intervention efforts .<br />finally , participants are contacted too infrequently to detect impending acute episodes .<br />while there are few easy solutions to address the flaws in this model , there are several evidence - based changes that could be implemented to increase the likelihood of achieving short - term medical cost savings .<br />these include : ( 1 ) drawing on clinical data and health risk assessments for patient identification and risk stratification ; ( 2 ) using behavior change experts in conjunction with patient and physician incentives for enrollment , participation , and retention ; and ( 3 ) tailoring the intervention to the risk level of the participant with the participants at highest risk for a near - term admission receiving daily monitoring via rtm as well as monthly medication reviews , quarterly process reminders , and seasonal interventions .<br />it is critical that changes be made to all dm program components as they are interdependent ; improving identification will only lead to medical cost savings if the enrollment process and interventions are properly designed .<br />however , making the model more robust could substantially increase the cost of implementing the program , increasing the medical cost savings required to deliver net savings .<br />placing this discussion in the context of mhs , at the conclusion of phase i cms will have to determine whether to authorize a second phase .<br />along with an assessment of beneficiary and provider satisfaction , process improvements , and health outcomes , cms will assess the financial outcomes .<br />the results of a simple nnd calculation suggest that , on average , a dm vendor participating in the mhs demonstration would have to reduce all - cause hospitalizations by about 15 percent to break even on fees alone .<br />if dm can only impact congestive heart failure and diabetes ( the primary and secondary conditions targeted by mhs ) , the percentage decrease in hospitalizations needed to achieve the cost savings target lies closer to the 82-percent reduction estimate .<br />the mhs interim report reflected few statistical or substantive differences in the rate of hospitalizations , 30-day readmissions , and emergency room visits between the intervention and control group after 6 months .<br />thus , in light of the dm model flaws , achieving a 15-percent reduction in all - cause admissions or an 82-percent reduction in disease - specific admissions is unlikely for the current programs .<br />if vendors implement the changes previously discussed , a sufficient reduction in hospitalizations may be achieved before the final mhs evaluation is conducted .<br />however , this will require further investment in the interventions on top of the current monthly fees that range from $ 74 to $ 159 per beneficiary ( mccall , cromwell , and bernard , 2007 ) .<br />thus the question remains as to whether commercial dm can achieve net cost savings in the chronically ill population .<br />ultimately cms will have to assess the potential for commercial dm to be more cost effective than alternative approaches currently under study in other demonstration projects in deciding how to proceed with managing the chronically ill .", "summary": "the medicare administration's chronic disease management ( dm ) demonstration projects are testing one approach to containing costs of the chronically ill. however, early success has been followed by withdrawal of early interventions by the eight participating companies and negative initial results in achieving cost savings. this article reviews the current state of dm literature, summarizes decision -

controlled design and require that vendors reimburse the medicare program in full if they are unable to achieve budget neutrality ( inclusive of vendor fees ) .<br />while official results of phase i are not due for over a year , three vendors have withdrawn early ( lifemasters , mckesson , and cigna as subcontractor to healthways ) and , in the preliminary evaluation of the first 6 months , the remaining projects have failed to achieve medical cost savings in excess of vendor fees ( mccall , cromwell , and bernard , 2007 ) .<br />these early results lend support to a growing body of literature concluding that commercial dm programs do not generate medical cost savings.the u.s .<br />congressional budget office ( 2004 )<br />review of the dm literature concluded that   there is insufficient evidence to conclude that disease management programs can generally reduce the overall cost of health care services .<br />the most recent review by mattke and colleagues , which included 317 individual studies , reported that <br /> when the costs of the intervention were appropriately accounted for and subtracted from any savings , there was no conclusive evidence that disease management leads to a net reduction of direct medical costs .<br />at the end of phase i , cms will face the decision of whether to expand mhs to a second phase .<br />if the early trends are indicative of the final phase i results , policymakers should consider the changes that must be made to the commercial dm model to improve the likelihood of achieving cost savings and then assess whether the model is sufficiently compelling , when compared to other chronic care management strategies , to justify pursuing it .<br />this article contributes to this process by describing the characteristics of the current commercial dm model that limit its ability to attain short - term medical cost savings and then discussing the changes required to overcome them .<br />prior to the initiation of a dm program , three questions should be answered to inform dm program design and set realistic expectations for the outcomes that will be realized : ( 1 ) what is the timeframe over which medical cost savings are expected to be achieved ?<br />( 2 ) given this timeframe , which categories of medical costs have the potential to be reduced ?<br />( 3 ) is there sufficient opportunity in a given population to achieve this targeted reduction in medical costs ?<br />the current commercial dm model suffers from a mismatch between the expectation of a short - run return on investment and an intervention that targets medium to long - term medical cost savings .<br />thus , the first step toward fixing the current dm model is to develop an internally consistent approach .<br />the answer to the first question should be guided by the financial requirements of the stakeholder seeking to pursue dm for their population .<br />although savings can be realized in the short , medium , and long term from altering the course of disease progression , most payers seek a short - term return on their investments .<br />for - profit organizations strive to maximize shareholder value and , along with nonprofit organizations , are hesitant to invest in long - term interventions when their population has significant turnover and they are not confident that the program will reduce medical costs .<br />the 3-year timeframe of the first phase of mhs reflects this focus on short - term medical cost savings . in the short term<br />, reductions may be more easily achieved for certain types of costs incurred by chronically ill populations .<br />in the commercially insured , medicare and medicaid populations ,<br />the single largest health expenditure is in patient utilization ( nearly 33 percent in 2005 ) with 13.3 percent of all emergency department visits associated with a hospital admission ( mccaig and newar , 2006 ) .<br />diagnoses for which timely and effective outpatient care reduces the risk of hospitalization ( billings et al . , 1993 ) .<br />the second and third largest health expenditures , physician and clinical services and prescription drugs , typically increase as part of successful interventions targeting chronic illness ( u.s .<br />congressional budget office , 2004 ; linden , 2006 ; ofman et al .<br />.<br />therefore , the primary opportunity for commercial dm programs to realize short - term medical cost savings is via reductions in costly avoidable hospitalizations and the emergency department visits that often lead to them ( linden , 2006 ) .<br />further , a focus on avoiding the first admission during the intervention period is critical given that hospitalizations for chronic illnesses are relatively rare events and individuals may only experience one hospitalization over the entire course of a program .<br />if the first admission is missed , the dm program may not have another opportunity to reduce the participant 's medical costs .<br />before initiating a dm program in a given population ,<br />a numbers needed to decrease ( nnd ) analysis should be conducted to assess whether there is sufficient opportunity for an intervention to achieve medical cost savings .<br />an nnd factors in variables including population - specific hospitalization rates , average cost per hospitalization , and the fees that will be charged by the vendor to project the percent of hospital admissions that need to be prevented to achieve a given savings target .<br />two recent studies using this analysis ( linden , 2006 ; linden and biuso , 2006 ) calculated that between 11 and 74 percent of hospitalizations needed to be reduced for a dm program to break even on fees .<br />an nnd for the mhs projects estimates a 15-percent reduction in all cause hospitalizations and an 82-percent reduction in disease - specific admissions ( congestive heart failure and diabetes ) to break even on fees alone ( table 1 ) .<br />an nnd also informs the size of the population that should be included in a dm intervention and the fees that should be paid to vendors .<br />the disease - specific hospitalization rate and<br />the percent of hospitalizations required to break even will vary in relation to the disease severity of the population ; in a sicker population with a higher attendant admissions rate , a lower percent of hospitalizations will need to be decreased to break even .<br />however , a narrowly focused program targeting only the sickest patients addresses only a small fraction of the total disease burden and is unlikely to achieve the goals of dm at the population level .<br />to determine a reasonable fee schedule<br />, the percent of hospitalizations the vendor expects to decrease in the specific population should be estimated and then , given the client 's average cost of a hospitalization , fees should be set below the expected savings .<br />under these two considerations , both dm vendors and their clients<br />are best served by a program that is able to reduce the greatest percent of hospitalizations in the largest chronically ill population .<br />to achieve this ,<br />each of the three components of the typical commercial dm model must be successfully executed .<br />first , individuals within the target population at risk for a near - term hospitalization must be accurately identified .<br />second , they must be enrolled and actively participate in the program for a meaningful period of time .<br />third , the program must include interventions that modify or close deficits in participant and/or provider behavior ( i.e. , self - care and care - seeking behaviors and medical treatment or management ) that lead to near - term hospital admissions .<br />as currently structured , the commercial dm model is not optimally executing any of the three components .<br />the typical approach , the barriers to realizing short - term cost savings , and recommendations to address the shortcomings are discussed for each component in the following section and summarized in table 2 .<br />dm programs typically use medical claims to identify patients with a specific chronic condition who were hospitalized in the prior year and then target them to receive an intensive intervention of regularly scheduled outbound calls from clinical staff .<br />participants with no medical claims for a hospitalization or emergency department visit in the prior year are classified as low risk and typically receive only quarterly mailings .<br />a recent study conducted in a large managed care population reveals the problem with this approach ( linden and goldberg , 2007 ) .<br />members hospitalized for a chronic illness in a given year were categorized by prior year hospitalization status .<br />the claims - based identification and stratification methodology , identical to that typically employed by dm companies , showed that only 6.4 percent of patients hospitalized in the current year had been hospitalized in the prior year .<br />thus , the vast majority of current year hospitalizations came from members who would have been misclassified by a dm company as low risk , unidentified due to lack of claims data , or newly enrolled in the health plan .<br />had these members been enrolled in a dm program that targeted only high risk patients based on prior hospitalizations they would have received either a minimal intervention or no intervention at all , making it highly improbable that the program could have prevented their hospitalizations .<br />dm programs are increasingly using predictive modeling to improve claims - based identification of individuals at risk for high medical costs .<br />these statistical models use past medical claims and other basic demographic data to predict future costs .<br />however , it requires past claims history in order to achieve any reasonable degree of accuracy , and it still fails to incorporate many factors that explain health care utilization that are not reflected in administrative data , such as predisposing and enabling factors and perceived need .<br />a recent study comparing the accuracy of several commercial models to predict high - cost participants based on their past claims history found that all models significantly underpredicted high - cost individuals and overpredicted low - cost individuals ( winkelman and mehmud , 2007 ) .<br />the best fitting model underpredicted costs by 73 percent in the highest cost percentile ( 99 - 100 ) and underpredicted costs by 52 percent in the 96 - 99th percentile of costs .<br />these models fared worse when no past claims history was available and therefore would be uninformative for new entrants to a population .<br />given the importance for dm programs to prospectively identify individuals who will incur high costs in the near future , such low predictive ability can lead dm vendors to miss the patients most likely to have an acute episode in the near term .<br />in light of these shortcomings , dm programs should look beyond claims data to other sources of patient data .<br />psychometrically validated health risk assessments ( hras ) developed to predict future hospitalizations should be used in conjunction with claims - based models and they offer a compelling alternative when no claims history is available .<br />several instruments have been developed specifically for the senior population ( boult et al . , 1993 ) and achieve reasonably good predictive accuracy ; the sensitivity - specificity tradeoff measured by an area under the curve is consistently around 70 percent ( wagner et al . , 2006 ) .<br />at program initiation these surveys can be distributed at the population level to improve identification , and then readministered quarterly to find incident cases as well as track changes in risk status of previously surveyed participants .<br />many dm programs have such tools available but use them on a very limited basis ; thus , increasing their use would not require a fundamental overhaul of the identification approach and , if administered electronically , would minimize the incremental cost .<br />there are two other potential approaches to identify patients at risk for a near - term hospitalization .<br />a direct referral from the patient 's physician is the most accurate means of identifying suitable candidates for a dm program .<br />despite the fact that many dm programs have a channel for such direct referrals , physicians rarely use them .<br />physicians may not be aware of patient eligibility for dm or may not support the program .<br />the broader issue of how to engage physicians in dm is discussed at the end of this section .<br />electronic medical records ( emr ) and other repositories of clinical data that include medication lists and laboratory values are rich sources of up - to - date patient information .<br />health systems such as kaiser permanente rely heavily on their emr for such purposes ( hyatt , taylor , and budge , 2004 ) , but outside of integrated delivery systems , third - party access to emr data would have to be negotiated .<br />thus , while both of these strategies are promising , under the current health care delivery system supplementing claims - based identification with hras is the most compelling approach to improve identification of high risk patients .<br />this process is labor intensive and time consuming , limiting the number of eligible persons that can be contacted in a timely fashion .<br />further , people are often wary of discussing health - related issues with strangers over the telephone and potential participants must be convinced that the program is legitimate . in commercial dm programs ,<br />enrollment rates are quite low and vary by disease , with asthma program enrollment rates averaging 10 percent and congestive heart failure program enrollment rates averaging 30 percent of the eligible population ( lewis , 2007 ) .<br />vendors in the mhs project are strongly incentivized to maximize enrollment within the required opt - in approach and have achieved high enrollment rates in the first 6 months of the mhs projects ranging from 65 to 92.3 percent ( mccall , cromwell , and bernard , 2007 ) .<br />however , mean time - to - agreement ranged from 37 to 100 days , revealing that in the best case it took over a month to enroll beneficiaries in the program .<br />further , those agreeing to participate were considerably healthier compared to non - participants , indicating that the beneficiaries who could most benefit from dm require even greater effort to enroll .<br />an hra is also helpful in the enrollment process as it identifies individuals who are ready to consider changing their health behaviors and as a result are more likely to enroll in the program .<br />the percentage of individuals in any given population that are ready to change their behavior is not easily quantified as it is highly dependent on how readiness to change is defined and differs by the particular behaviors that are targeted .<br />most survey instruments include questions based on prochaska 's ( 1979 ) stages of change psychosocial model for determining the level of readiness to change .<br />participants who are at least contemplating change , once identified , should be contacted by program representatives trained in behavior change methods , such as motivational interviewing .<br />such techniques help participants overcome ambivalence and increase likelihood of enrollment ( miller and rollnick , 1991 ) .<br />representatives who are not trained in these methods may be too directive or confrontational , which can reverse a prior commitment to change ( amrhein et al . , 2003 ) and discourage participation .<br />given the expense associated with telephonic enrollment , programs implemented in large populations should consider the use of interactive voice recognition ( ivr ) or web - enabled technologies to maximize the outreach to eligible participants .<br />a tradeoff exists between the narrow - and - deep telephonic approach and the wide - and - shallow approach that ivr technologies facilitate .<br />an optimal enrollment model would include a technologically - based outreach process that draws on motivational interviewing methods .<br />however , this combination is not currently mature enough to be widely available .<br />thus , the choice of approach should be driven by the broader decision on the size of the population targeted to receive the intervention .<br />for example , one employer - based program achieved a 90-percent hra response rate when a $ 500 rebate on medical premiums was offered , compared to a 20-percent response rate with no incentive ( finkelstein and kosa , 2003 ) .<br />a recent study demonstrated that even modest incentives were effective in motivating overweight employees to lose weight .<br />after 3 months , individuals who received $ 14 for their participation lost 4.7 pounds on average compared to only 2 pounds in the control group ( finkelstein et al . , 2007 ) .<br />physician incentives can further bolster enrollment by sharing the cost savings associated with the program or by providing a pay - for - performance initiative in which they are paid for enrolling and supporting their patients in the program .<br />while incentives increase program costs , at the right level they may be offset by a concomitant increase in enrollment and active engagement assuming that the sub sequent intervention reduces medical costs .<br />for participants classified as high risk , most commercial dm programs share a common intervention approach focused on improving process measures ( e.g. , increasing regular testing of glycosylated hemoglobin [ hba1c ] in diabetics ) in order to avoid costly complications in the future .<br />since most process measures are performed periodically ( i.e. , diabetics should receive an hba1c test between two and four times per year ) , the core dm intervention is comprised of patient calls around the time that these tests should occur .<br />a recent study conducted by healthways , inc .<br />reported that program participants with diabetes ( 245,668 unique members with diabetes from 25 different health plans across the united states ) received no more than four calls in their first 12 months of the program ( coberley et al . , 2007 ) .<br />while periodic calls to participants have proven adequate to elicit improvements in screening rates ( coberley et al . , 2007 ) , they are insufficient to pick up on signs that patients are at risk for a near - term emergency department visit or hospitalization .<br />further , there is evidence to suggest that most clinical practice guidelines for chronic illnesses are not modified to consider the needs of older patients with multiple and complex comorbidities ( boyd et al . , 2005 ) .<br />thus , it is possible that this emphasis on adherence to practice guidelines focuses on the wrong aspects of care for this population and may have a detrimental effect on outcomes .<br />several interventions have been shown to be successful at reducing avoidable admissions , but they require a greater frequency of patient contact than is currently the norm .<br />most participants at highest risk of a near - term hospitalization need to be assessed daily .<br />one strategy is to use outbound calls conducted by individuals proficient in behavior change methodologies .<br />remote telemonitoring ( rtm ) technology offers an alternative strategy for assessing patient status and is typically less costly than daily outbound calls .<br />via rtm ,<br />the signs or symptoms of an impending acute exacerbation triggers an alert to a nurse who can respond immediately and triage the patient to the appropriate ambulatory care setting .<br />for example , daily monitoring of congestive heart failure patients catches symptoms including weight gain , lower extremity edema , and increasing dyspnea that are typically present in the 8 to 12 days prior to hospitalization ( schiff et al . ,<br />a recent systematic review of rtm reported that , in the majority of studies of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cardiac diseases , rtm led to significant decreases in hospitalizations , emergency department visits , and length of stay ; studies of diabetes and hypertension had mixed results ( pare , jaana , and sicotte , 2007 ) .<br />however , rtm is expensive and , in diabetes , it is estimated to cost between $ 300 and $ 400 per patient per year when sponsored by a physician practice ( adler - milstein<br />et<br />al . , 2007 ) .<br />other interventions shown to reduce near - term avoidable admissions include the provision of seasonal influenza vaccinations ( nichol , baken , and nelson , 1999 ) and a monthly pharmacist review of a patient 's medication profile ( hepler and strand , 1990 ) .<br />the latter may substantially reduce avoidable hospitalizations caused by drug - related problems such as untreated indications , use of the medication without indication , improper drug selection , subtherapeutic dosage , overdose , adverse re actions , interactions , and failure to receive the drug ( strand , morley , and cipolle , 1990 ) .<br />one of the biggest challenges in commercial dm is engaging physicians to support the program .<br />these programs have little ability to collaborate with physicians , many of whom are skeptical of dm initiatives and view them as disruptive to the physician - patient relationship ( leider , 1999 ) .<br />without explicit endorsement from their physician<br />, many patients will not enroll or adhere to the intervention provided by the dm program ( leider , 1999 ) .<br />this is problematic as physicians are well positioned to identify potential participants and persuade them to participate in a dm program .<br />further , when physicians are actively involved in the intervention process , it is more likely that a dm program will be able to effectuate sufficient change in a patient 's clinical condition to avoid an acute exacerbation .<br />a recent article on the role of physicians in dm reports several barriers to physician engagement including a lack of financial incentive , a lack of technology to facilitate communication , and the need for a trusted practice - based program champion ( kuraitis , 2007 ) .<br />leider ( 1999 ) suggests five core strategies to achieve physician buy - in for disease management programs .<br />these include ( 1 ) educating physicians on the goals of the dm program , ( 2 ) identifying champions with positive views of the program , ( 3 ) setting clear goals and expectations for physicians who participate in the program , ( 4 ) demonstrating that a relatively easy program works before attempting a more complex or controversial program , and ( 5 ) sharing the gains by rewarding physicians for their time and effort supporting the program .<br />while such strategies are likely to strengthen physician support of commercial dm , they raise the broader question of the appropriate role for each player in supporting chronic dm .<br />some view commercial dm companies as filling a gap in our acute care focused delivery system that has consistently failed to deliver high - quality care to those with chronic illnesses .<br />however , the flaws of a third - party work - around are evident in the increased fragmentation of care that results from a lack of coordination between dm vendors and traditional care delivery settings .<br />a compelling alternative is wagner 's chronic care model that includes a primary care - based medical home<br />.<br />proponents of this model believe that the primary care team is the entity best suited to deliver chronic care management ( geyman , 2007 ) .<br />in this model<br />, the primary care physician leads a team of specialists , nurses , dieticians , pharmacists , and health educators to provide and coordinate all the care for a chronically ill population .<br />with evidence of cost reduction and quality improvement from group health cooperative and kaiser permanente , primary case - based dm enjoys empirical support ( mcculloch et al . , 2000 ) .<br />recent pay - for - performance programs that attempt to align payment incentives with high - quality chronic care also reflect a belief that chronic care is the responsibility of physicians and the systems in which they operate ( rosenthal et al . , 2007 ) .<br />dm programs typically use medical claims to identify patients with a specific chronic condition who were hospitalized in the prior year and then target them to receive an intensive intervention of regularly scheduled outbound calls from clinical staff .<br />participants with no medical claims for a hospitalization or emergency department visit in the prior year are classified as low risk and typically receive only quarterly mailings .<br />a recent study conducted in a large managed care population reveals the problem with this approach ( linden and goldberg , 2007 ) .<br />members hospitalized for a chronic illness in a given year were categorized by prior year hospitalization status .<br />the claims -

quality care to those with chronic illnesses .<br />however , the flaws of a third - party work - around are evident in the increased fragmentation of care that results from a lack of coordination between dm vendors and traditional care delivery settings .<br />a compelling alternative is wagner 's chronic care model that includes a primary care - based medical home .<br />proponents of this model believe that the primary care team is the entity best suited to deliver chronic care management ( geyman , 2007 ) .<br />in this model<br />, the primary care physician leads a team of specialists , nurses , dieticians , pharmacists , and health educators to provide and coordinate all the care for a chronically ill population .<br />with evidence of cost reduction and quality improvement from group health cooperative and kaiser permanente , primary case - based dm enjoys empirical support ( mcculloch et al . , 2000 ) .<br />recent pay - for - performance programs that attempt to align payment incentives with high - quality chronic care also reflect a belief that chronic care is the responsibility of physicians and the systems in which they operate ( rosenthal et al . , 2007 ) .<br />the current commercial dm model has shortcomings within each program component that severely limit the short - term medical cost savings that can be achieved .<br />by relying on claims data<br />, individuals at risk for a near - term hospitalization can not be accurately identified .<br />behavior change specialists and physicians are not actively engaged to support recruitment and intervention efforts .<br />finally , participants are contacted too infrequently to detect impending acute episodes .<br />while there are few easy solutions to address the flaws in this model , there are several evidence - based changes that could be implemented to increase the likelihood of achieving short - term medical cost savings .<br />these include : ( 1 ) drawing on clinical data and health risk assessments for patient identification and risk stratification ; ( 2 ) using behavior change experts in conjunction with patient and physician incentives for enrollment , participation , and retention ; and ( 3 ) tailoring the intervention to the risk level of the participant with the participants at highest risk for a near - term admission receiving daily monitoring via rtm as well as monthly medication reviews , quarterly process reminders , and seasonal interventions .<br />it is critical that changes be made to all dm program components as they are interdependent ; improving identification will only lead to medical cost savings if the enrollment process and interventions are properly designed .<br />however , making the model more robust could substantially increase the cost of implementing the program , increasing the medical cost savings required to deliver net savings .<br />placing this discussion in the context of mhs , at the conclusion of phase i cms will have to determine whether to authorize a second phase .<br />along with an assessment of beneficiary and provider satisfaction , process improvements , and health outcomes , cms will assess the financial outcomes .<br />the results of a simple nnd calculation suggest that , on average , a dm vendor participating in the mhs demonstration would have to reduce all - cause hospitalizations by about 15 percent to break even on fees alone .<br />if dm can only impact congestive heart failure and diabetes ( the primary and secondary conditions targeted by mhs ) , the percentage decrease in hospitalizations needed to achieve the cost savings target lies closer to the 82-percent reduction estimate .<br />the mhs interim report reflected few statistical or substantive differences in the rate of hospitalizations , 30-day readmissions , and emergency room visits between the intervention and control group after 6 months .<br />thus , in light of the dm model flaws , achieving a 15-percent reduction in all - cause admissions or an 82-percent reduction in disease - specific admissions is unlikely for the current programs .<br />if vendors implement the changes previously discussed , a sufficient reduction in hospitalizations may be achieved before the final mhs evaluation is conducted .<br />however , this will require further investment in the interventions on top of the current monthly fees that range from $ 74 to $ 159 per beneficiary ( mccall , cromwell , and bernard , 2007 ) .<br />thus the question remains as to whether commercial dm can achieve net cost savings in the chronically ill population .<br />ultimately cms will have to assess the potential for commercial dm to be more cost effective than alternative approaches currently under study in other demonstration projects in deciding how to proceed with managing the chronically ill .", "summary": "interim results of the medicare health support ( mhs ) demonstration projects suggest that commercial disease management ( dm ) is unable to deliver short - term medical cost savings . this is not surprising given the current dm program focus on compliance with process measures that may only lead to cost savings in the long term . a program focused on reducing near - term hospitalizations is more likely to deliver savings during the initial 3-year phase of mhs . if the early trends in mhs are indicative of the final results , cms will face the decision of whether to abandon commercial dm in favor of other chronic care management strategies . this article supports the upcoming assessment by describing the characteristics of the current commercial dm model that limit its ability to deliver short - term medical cost savings and the changes required to overcome these limitations ."}, "article_14_longt5": {"source_doc": "as rising health care costs continue to draw attention , the rate of increase in medicare expenditures , which significantly exceeded those of the overall u.s .<br />health care system ( 9.3 versus 6.9 percent in 2005 ) , is of particular concern to policymakers .<br />the escalation in medicare part a spending is consuming a greater share of federal revenue , and current projections suggest that medicare outlays will exceed dedicated revenues by 45 percent of total expenditures in 2012 with the hospital insurance trust fund remaining solvent until 2018 .<br />underlying<br />chronic conditions are a leading cause of illness , disability , and death among medicare beneficiaries and account for a disproportionate share of health care expenditures .<br />while approximately 14 percent of medicare beneficiaries have heart failure , they account for 43 percent of medicare spending .<br />approximately 18 percent of medicare beneficiaries have diabetes , yet they account for 32 percent of medicare spending .<br />thus , to limit increases in overall program expenditures , congress is actively pursuing strategies to contain costs of the chronically ill subset of beneficiaries .<br />with many approaches to chronic dm and little agreement on the most effective approach ,<br />the 2003 medicare modernization act included several demonstration projects to assess the various approaches and inform medicare 's chronic dm strategy .<br />section 721 of the act , known as mhs , tests one approach in which commercial vendors provide dm interventions to fee - for - service beneficiaries with chronic illnesses .<br />these 3-year demonstration projects were awarded to eight companies , with the first programs becoming operational in august 2005 , and the eighth and final program becoming operational in january 2006 .<br />the pilots follow a randomized - controlled design and require that vendors reimburse the medicare program in full if they are unable to achieve budget neutrality ( inclusive of vendor fees ) .<br />while official results of phase i are not due for over a year , three vendors have withdrawn early ( lifemasters , mckesson , and cigna as subcontractor to healthways ) and , in the preliminary evaluation of the first 6 months , the remaining projects have failed to achieve medical cost savings in excess of vendor fees ( mccall , cromwell , and bernard , 2007 ) .<br />these early results lend support to a growing body of literature concluding that commercial dm programs do not generate medical cost savings.the u.s .<br />congressional budget office ( 2004 )<br />review of the dm literature concluded that   there is insufficient evidence to conclude that disease management programs can generally reduce the overall cost of health care services .<br />the most recent review by mattke and colleagues , which included 317 individual studies , reported that <br /> when the costs of the intervention were appropriately accounted for and subtracted from any savings , there was no conclusive evidence that disease management leads to a net reduction of direct medical costs .<br />at the end of phase i , cms will face the decision of whether to expand mhs to a second phase .<br />if the early trends are indicative of the final phase i results , policymakers should consider the changes that must be made to the commercial dm model to improve the likelihood of achieving cost savings and then assess whether the model is sufficiently compelling , when compared to other chronic care management strategies , to justify pursuing it .<br />this article contributes to this process by describing the characteristics of the current commercial dm model that limit its ability to attain short - term medical cost savings and then discussing the changes required to overcome them .<br />prior to the initiation of a dm program , three questions should be answered to inform dm program design and set realistic expectations for the outcomes that will be realized : ( 1 ) what is the timeframe over which medical cost savings are expected to be achieved ?<br />( 2 ) given this timeframe , which categories of medical costs have the potential to be reduced ?<br />( 3 ) is there sufficient opportunity in a given population to achieve this targeted reduction in medical costs ?<br />the current commercial dm model suffers from a mismatch between the expectation of a short - run return on investment and an intervention that targets medium to long - term medical cost savings .<br />thus , the first step toward fixing the current dm model is to develop an internally consistent approach .<br />the answer to the first question should be guided by the financial requirements of the stakeholder seeking to pursue dm for their population .<br />although savings can be realized in the short , medium , and long term from altering the course of disease progression , most payers seek a short - term return on their investments .<br />for - profit organizations strive to maximize shareholder value and , along with nonprofit organizations , are hesitant to invest in long - term interventions when their population has significant turnover and they are not confident that the program will reduce medical costs .<br />the 3-year timeframe of the first phase of mhs reflects this focus on short - term medical cost savings . in the short term<br />, reductions may be more easily achieved for certain types of costs incurred by chronically ill populations .<br />in the commercially insured , medicare and medicaid populations ,<br />the single largest health expenditure is in patient utilization ( nearly 33 percent in 2005 ) with 13.3 percent of all emergency department visits associated with a hospital admission ( mccaig and newar , 2006 ) .<br />diagnoses for which timely and effective outpatient care reduces the risk of hospitalization ( billings et al . , 1993 ) .<br />the second and third largest health expenditures , physician and clinical services and prescription drugs , typically increase as part of successful interventions targeting chronic illness ( u.s .<br />congressional budget office , 2004 ; linden , 2006 ; ofman et al .<br />.<br />therefore , the primary opportunity for commercial dm programs to realize short - term medical cost savings is via reductions in costly avoidable hospitalizations and the emergency department visits that often lead to them ( linden , 2006 ) .<br />further , a focus on avoiding the first admission during the intervention period is critical given that hospitalizations for chronic illnesses are relatively rare events and individuals may only experience one hospitalization over the entire course of a program .<br />if the first admission is missed , the dm program may not have another opportunity to reduce the participant 's medical costs .<br />before initiating a dm program in a given population ,<br />a numbers needed to decrease ( nnd ) analysis should be conducted to assess whether there is sufficient opportunity for an intervention to achieve medical cost savings .<br />an nnd factors in variables including population - specific hospitalization rates , average cost per hospitalization , and the fees that will be charged by the vendor to project the percent of hospital admissions that need to be prevented to achieve a given savings target .<br />two recent studies using this analysis ( linden , 2006 ; linden and biuso , 2006 ) calculated that between 11 and 74 percent of hospitalizations needed to be reduced for a dm program to break even on fees .<br />an nnd for the mhs projects estimates a 15-percent reduction in all cause hospitalizations and an 82-percent reduction in disease - specific admissions ( congestive heart failure and diabetes ) to break even on fees alone ( table 1 ) .<br />an nnd also informs the size of the population that should be included in a dm intervention and the fees that should be paid to vendors .<br />the disease - specific hospitalization rate and<br />the percent of hospitalizations required to break even will vary in relation to the disease severity of the population ; in a sicker population with a higher attendant admissions rate , a lower percent of hospitalizations will need to be decreased to break even .<br />however , a narrowly focused program targeting only the sickest patients addresses only a small fraction of the total disease burden and is unlikely to achieve the goals of dm at the population level .<br />to determine a reasonable fee schedule<br />, the percent of hospitalizations the vendor expects to decrease in the specific population should be estimated and then , given the client 's average cost of a hospitalization , fees should be set below the expected savings .<br />under these two considerations , both dm vendors and their clients<br />are best served by a program that is able to reduce the greatest percent of hospitalizations in the largest chronically ill population .<br />to achieve this ,<br />each of the three components of the typical commercial dm model must be successfully executed .<br />first , individuals within the target population at risk for a near - term hospitalization must be accurately identified .<br />second , they must be enrolled and actively participate in the program for a meaningful period of time .<br />third , the program must include interventions that modify or close deficits in participant and/or provider behavior ( i.e. , self - care and care - seeking behaviors and medical treatment or management ) that lead to near - term hospital admissions .<br />as currently structured , the commercial dm model is not optimally executing any of the three components .<br />the typical approach , the barriers to realizing short - term cost savings , and recommendations to address the shortcomings are discussed for each component in the following section and summarized in table 2 .<br />dm programs typically use medical claims to identify patients with a specific chronic condition who were hospitalized in the prior year and then target them to receive an intensive intervention of regularly scheduled outbound calls from clinical staff .<br />participants with no medical claims for a hospitalization or emergency department visit in the prior year are classified as low risk and typically receive only quarterly mailings .<br />a recent study conducted in a large managed care population reveals the problem with this approach ( linden and goldberg , 2007 ) .<br />members hospitalized for a chronic illness in a given year were categorized by prior year hospitalization status .<br />the claims - based identification and stratification methodology , identical to that typically employed by dm companies , showed that only 6.4 percent of patients hospitalized in the current year had been hospitalized in the prior year .<br />thus , the vast majority of current year hospitalizations came from members who would have been misclassified by a dm company as low risk , unidentified due to lack of claims data , or newly enrolled in the health plan .<br />had these members been enrolled in a dm program that targeted only high risk patients based on prior hospitalizations they would have received either a minimal intervention or no intervention at all , making it highly improbable that the program could have prevented their hospitalizations .<br />dm programs are increasingly using predictive modeling to improve claims - based identification of individuals at risk for high medical costs .<br />these statistical models use past medical claims and other basic demographic data to predict future costs .<br />however , it requires past claims history in order to achieve any reasonable degree of accuracy , and it still fails to incorporate many factors that explain health care utilization that are not reflected in administrative data , such as predisposing and enabling factors and perceived need .<br />a recent study comparing the accuracy of several commercial models to predict high - cost participants based on their past claims history found that all models significantly underpredicted high - cost individuals and overpredicted low - cost individuals ( winkelman and mehmud , 2007 ) .<br />the best fitting model underpredicted costs by 73 percent in the highest cost percentile ( 99 - 100 ) and underpredicted costs by 52 percent in the 96 - 99th percentile of costs .<br />these models fared worse when no past claims history was available and therefore would be uninformative for new entrants to a population .<br />given the importance for dm programs to prospectively identify individuals who will incur high costs in the near future , such low predictive ability can lead dm vendors to miss the patients most likely to have an acute episode in the near term .<br />in light of these shortcomings , dm programs should look beyond claims data to other sources of patient data .<br />psychometrically validated health risk assessments ( hras ) developed to predict future hospitalizations should be used in conjunction with claims - based models and they offer a compelling alternative when no claims history is available .<br />several instruments have been developed specifically for the senior population ( boult et al . , 1993 ) and achieve reasonably good predictive accuracy ; the sensitivity - specificity tradeoff measured by an area under the curve is consistently around 70 percent ( wagner et al . , 2006 ) .<br />at program initiation these surveys can be distributed at the population level to improve identification , and then readministered quarterly to find incident cases as well as track changes in risk status of previously surveyed participants .<br />many dm programs have such tools available but use them on a very limited basis ; thus , increasing their use would not require a fundamental overhaul of the identification approach and , if administered electronically , would minimize the incremental cost .<br />there are two other potential approaches to identify patients at risk for a near - term hospitalization .<br />a direct referral from the patient 's physician is the most accurate means of identifying suitable candidates for a dm program .<br />despite the fact that many dm programs have a channel for such direct referrals , physicians rarely use them .<br />physicians may not be aware of patient eligibility for dm or may not support the program .<br />the broader issue of how to engage physicians in dm is discussed at the end of this section .<br />electronic medical records ( emr ) and other repositories of clinical data that include medication lists and laboratory values are rich sources of up - to - date patient information .<br />health systems such as kaiser permanente rely heavily on their emr for such purposes ( hyatt , taylor , and budge , 2004 ) , but outside of integrated delivery systems , third - party access to emr data would have to be negotiated .<br />thus , while both of these strategies are promising , under the current health care delivery system supplementing claims - based identification with hras is the most compelling approach to improve identification of high risk patients .<br />this process is labor intensive and time consuming , limiting the number of eligible persons that can be contacted in a timely fashion .<br />further , people are often wary of discussing health - related issues with strangers over the telephone and potential participants must be convinced that the program is legitimate . in commercial dm programs ,<br />enrollment rates are quite low and vary by disease , with asthma program enrollment rates averaging 10 percent and congestive heart failure program enrollment rates averaging 30 percent of the eligible population ( lewis , 2007 ) .<br />vendors in the mhs project are strongly incentivized to maximize enrollment within the required opt - in approach and have achieved high enrollment rates in the first 6 months of the mhs projects ranging from 65 to 92.3 percent ( mccall , cromwell , and bernard , 2007 ) .<br />however , mean time - to - agreement ranged from 37 to 100 days , revealing that in the best case it took over a month to enroll beneficiaries in the program .<br />further , those agreeing to participate were considerably healthier compared to non - participants , indicating that the beneficiaries who could most benefit from dm require even greater effort to enroll .<br />an hra is also helpful in the enrollment process as it identifies individuals who are ready to consider changing their health behaviors and as a result are more likely to enroll in the program .<br />the percentage of individuals in any given population that are ready to change their behavior is not easily quantified as it is highly dependent on how readiness to change is defined and differs by the particular behaviors that are targeted .<br />most survey instruments include questions based on prochaska 's ( 1979 ) stages of change psychosocial model for determining the level of readiness to change .<br />participants who are at least contemplating change , once identified , should be contacted by program representatives trained in behavior change methods , such as motivational interviewing .<br />such techniques help participants overcome ambivalence and increase likelihood of enrollment ( miller and rollnick , 1991 ) .<br />representatives who are not trained in these methods may be too directive or confrontational , which can reverse a prior commitment to change ( amrhein et al . , 2003 ) and discourage participation .<br />given the expense associated with telephonic enrollment , programs implemented in large populations should consider the use of interactive voice recognition ( ivr ) or web - enabled technologies to maximize the outreach to eligible participants .<br />a tradeoff exists between the narrow - and - deep telephonic approach and the wide - and - shallow approach that ivr technologies facilitate .<br />an optimal enrollment model would include a technologically - based outreach process that draws on motivational interviewing methods .<br />however , this combination is not currently mature enough to be widely available .<br />thus , the choice of approach should be driven by the broader decision on the size of the population targeted to receive the intervention .<br />for example , one employer - based program achieved a 90-percent hra response rate when a $ 500 rebate on medical premiums was offered , compared to a 20-percent response rate with no incentive ( finkelstein and kosa , 2003 ) .<br />a recent study demonstrated that even modest incentives were effective in motivating overweight employees to lose weight .<br />after 3 months , individuals who received $ 14 for their participation lost 4.7 pounds on average compared to only 2 pounds in the control group ( finkelstein et al . , 2007 ) .<br />physician incentives can further bolster enrollment by sharing the cost savings associated with the program or by providing a pay - for - performance initiative in which they are paid for enrolling and supporting their patients in the program .<br />while incentives increase program costs , at the right level they may be offset by a concomitant increase in enrollment and active engagement assuming that the sub sequent intervention reduces medical costs .<br />for participants classified as high risk , most commercial dm programs share a common intervention approach focused on improving process measures ( e.g. , increasing regular testing of glycosylated hemoglobin [ hba1c ] in diabetics ) in order to avoid costly complications in the future .<br />since most process measures are performed periodically ( i.e. , diabetics should receive an hba1c test between two and four times per year ) , the core dm intervention is comprised of patient calls around the time that these tests should occur .<br />a recent study conducted by healthways , inc .<br />reported that program participants with diabetes ( 245,668 unique members with diabetes from 25 different health plans across the united states ) received no more than four calls in their first 12 months of the program ( coberley et al . , 2007 ) .<br />while periodic calls to participants have proven adequate to elicit improvements in screening rates ( coberley et al . , 2007 ) , they are insufficient to pick up on signs that patients are at risk for a near - term emergency department visit or hospitalization .<br />further , there is evidence to suggest that most clinical practice guidelines for chronic illnesses are not modified to consider the needs of older patients with multiple and complex comorbidities ( boyd et al . , 2005 ) .<br />thus , it is possible that this emphasis on adherence to practice guidelines focuses on the wrong aspects of care for this population and may have a detrimental effect on outcomes .<br />several interventions have been shown to be successful at reducing avoidable admissions , but they require a greater frequency of patient contact than is currently the norm .<br />most participants at highest risk of a near - term hospitalization need to be assessed daily .<br />one strategy is to use outbound calls conducted by individuals proficient in behavior change methodologies .<br />remote telemonitoring ( rtm ) technology offers an alternative strategy for assessing patient status and is typically less costly than daily outbound calls .<br />via rtm ,<br />the signs or symptoms of an impending acute exacerbation triggers an alert to a nurse who can respond immediately and triage the patient to the appropriate ambulatory care setting .<br />for example , daily monitoring of congestive heart failure patients catches symptoms including weight gain , lower extremity edema , and increasing dyspnea that are typically present in the 8 to 12 days prior to hospitalization ( schiff et al . ,<br />a recent systematic review of rtm reported that , in the majority of studies of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cardiac diseases , rtm led to significant decreases in hospitalizations , emergency department visits , and length of stay ; studies of diabetes and hypertension had mixed results ( pare , jaana , and sicotte , 2007 ) .<br />however , rtm is expensive and , in diabetes , it is estimated to cost between $ 300 and $ 400 per patient per year when sponsored by a physician practice ( adler - milstein<br />et<br />al . , 2007 ) .<br />other interventions shown to reduce near - term avoidable admissions include the provision of seasonal influenza vaccinations ( nichol , baken , and nelson , 1999 ) and a monthly pharmacist review of a patient 's medication profile ( hepler and strand , 1990 ) .<br />the latter may substantially reduce avoidable hospitalizations caused by drug - related problems such as untreated indications , use of the medication without indication , improper drug selection , subtherapeutic dosage , overdose , adverse re actions , interactions , and failure to receive the drug ( strand , morley , and cipolle , 1990 ) .<br />one of the biggest challenges in commercial dm is engaging physicians to support the program .<br />these programs have little ability to collaborate with physicians , many of whom are skeptical of dm initiatives and view them as disruptive to the physician - patient relationship ( leider , 1999 ) .<br />without explicit endorsement from their physician<br />, many patients will not enroll or adhere to the intervention provided by the dm program ( leider , 1999 ) .<br />this is problematic as physicians are well positioned to identify potential participants and persuade them to participate in a dm program .<br />further , when physicians are actively involved in the intervention process , it is more likely that a dm program will be able to effectuate sufficient change in a patient 's clinical condition to avoid an acute exacerbation .<br />a recent article on the role of physicians in dm reports several barriers to physician engagement including a lack of financial incentive , a lack of technology to facilitate communication , and the need for a trusted practice -

related issues with strangers over the telephone and potential participants must be convinced that the program is legitimate . in commercial dm programs ,<br />enrollment rates are quite low and vary by disease , with asthma program enrollment rates averaging 10 percent and congestive heart failure program enrollment rates averaging 30 percent of the eligible population ( lewis , 2007 ) .<br />vendors in the mhs project are strongly incentivized to maximize enrollment within the required opt - in approach and have achieved high enrollment rates in the first 6 months of the mhs projects ranging from 65 to 92.3 percent ( mccall , cromwell , and bernard , 2007 ) .<br />however , mean time - to - agreement ranged from 37 to 100 days , revealing that in the best case it took over a month to enroll beneficiaries in the program .<br />further , those agreeing to participate were considerably healthier compared to non - participants , indicating that the beneficiaries who could most benefit from dm require even greater effort to enroll .<br />an hra is also helpful in the enrollment process as it identifies individuals who are ready to consider changing their health behaviors and as a result are more likely to enroll in the program .<br />the percentage of individuals in any given population that are ready to change their behavior is not easily quantified as it is highly dependent on how readiness to change is defined and differs by the particular behaviors that are targeted .<br />most survey instruments include questions based on prochaska 's ( 1979 ) stages of change psychosocial model for determining the level of readiness to change .<br />participants who are at least contemplating change , once identified , should be contacted by program representatives trained in behavior change methods , such as motivational interviewing .<br />such techniques help participants overcome ambivalence and increase likelihood of enrollment ( miller and rollnick , 1991 ) .<br />representatives who are not trained in these methods may be too directive or confrontational , which can reverse a prior commitment to change ( amrhein et al . , 2003 ) and discourage participation .<br />given the expense associated with telephonic enrollment , programs implemented in large populations should consider the use of interactive voice recognition ( ivr ) or web - enabled technologies to maximize the outreach to eligible participants .<br />a tradeoff exists between the narrow - and - deep telephonic approach and the wide - and - shallow approach that ivr technologies facilitate .<br />an optimal enrollment model would include a technologically - based outreach process that draws on motivational interviewing methods .<br />however , this combination is not currently mature enough to be widely available .<br />thus , the choice of approach should be driven by the broader decision on the size of the population targeted to receive the intervention .<br />for example , one employer - based program achieved a 90-percent hra response rate when a $ 500 rebate on medical premiums was offered , compared to a 20-percent response rate with no incentive ( finkelstein and kosa , 2003 ) .<br />a recent study demonstrated that even modest incentives were effective in motivating overweight employees to lose weight .<br />after 3 months , individuals who received $ 14 for their participation lost 4.7 pounds on average compared to only 2 pounds in the control group ( finkelstein et al . , 2007 ) .<br />physician incentives can further bolster enrollment by sharing the cost savings associated with the program or by providing a pay - for - performance initiative in which they are paid for enrolling and supporting their patients in the program .<br />while incentives increase program costs , at the right level they may be offset by a concomitant increase in enrollment and active engagement assuming that the sub sequent intervention reduces medical costs .<br />for participants classified as high risk , most commercial dm programs share a common intervention approach focused on improving process measures ( e.g. , increasing regular testing of glycosylated hemoglobin [ hba1c ] in diabetics ) in order to avoid costly complications in the future .<br />since most process measures are performed periodically ( i.e. , diabetics should receive an hba1c test between two and four times per year ) , the core dm intervention is comprised of patient calls around the time that these tests should occur .<br />a recent study conducted by healthways , inc . reported that program participants with diabetes ( 245,668 unique members with diabetes from 25 different health plans across the united states ) received no more than four calls in their first 12 months of the program ( coberley et al . , 2007 ) .<br />while periodic calls to participants have proven adequate to elicit improvements in screening rates ( coberley et al . , 2007 )<br />, they are insufficient to pick up on signs that patients are at risk for a near - term emergency department visit or hospitalization .<br />further , there is evidence to suggest that most clinical practice guidelines for chronic illnesses are not modified to consider the needs of older patients with multiple and complex comorbidities ( boyd et al . , 2005 ) .<br />thus , it is possible that this emphasis on adherence to practice guidelines focuses on the wrong aspects of care for this population and may have a detrimental effect on outcomes .<br />several interventions have been shown to be successful at reducing avoidable admissions , but they require a greater frequency of patient contact than is currently the norm .<br />most participants at highest risk of a near - term hospitalization need to be assessed daily .<br />one strategy is to use outbound calls conducted by individuals proficient in behavior change methodologies .<br />remote telemonitoring ( rtm ) technology offers an alternative strategy for assessing patient status and is typically less costly than daily outbound calls .<br />via rtm , the signs or symptoms of an impending acute exacerbation triggers an alert to a nurse who can respond immediately and triage the patient to the appropriate ambulatory care setting .<br />for example , daily monitoring of congestive heart failure patients catches symptoms including weight gain , lower extremity edema , and increasing dyspnea that are typically present in the 8 to 12 days prior to hospitalization ( schiff et al . ,<br />a recent systematic review of rtm reported that , in the majority of studies of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cardiac diseases , rtm led to significant decreases in hospitalizations , emergency department visits , and length of stay ; studies of diabetes and hypertension had mixed results ( pare , jaana , and sicotte , 2007 ) .<br />however , rtm is expensive and , in diabetes , it is estimated to cost between $ 300 and $ 400 per patient per year when sponsored by a physician practice ( adler - milstein<br />et<br />al . , 2007 ) .<br />other interventions shown to reduce near - term avoidable admissions include the provision of seasonal influenza vaccinations ( nichol , baken , and nelson , 1999 ) and a monthly pharmacist review of a patient 's medication profile ( hepler and strand , 1990 ) .<br />the latter may substantially reduce avoidable hospitalizations caused by drug - related problems such as untreated indications , use of the medication without indication , improper drug selection , subtherapeutic dosage , overdose , adverse re actions , interactions , and failure to receive the drug ( strand , morley , and cipolle , 1990 ) .<br />one of the biggest challenges in commercial dm is engaging physicians to support the program .<br />these programs have little ability to collaborate with physicians , many of whom are skeptical of dm initiatives and view them as disruptive to the physician - patient relationship ( leider , 1999 ) .<br />without explicit endorsement from their physician<br />, many patients will not enroll or adhere to the intervention provided by the dm program ( leider , 1999 ) .<br />this is problematic as physicians are well positioned to identify potential participants and persuade them to participate in a dm program .<br />further , when physicians are actively involved in the intervention process , it is more likely that a dm program will be able to effectuate sufficient change in a patient 's clinical condition to avoid an acute exacerbation .<br />a recent article on the role of physicians in dm reports several barriers to physician engagement including a lack of financial incentive , a lack of technology to facilitate communication , and the need for a trusted practice - based program champion ( kuraitis , 2007 ) .<br />leider ( 1999 ) suggests five core strategies to achieve physician buy - in for disease management programs .<br />these include ( 1 ) educating physicians on the goals of the dm program , ( 2 ) identifying champions with positive views of the program , ( 3 ) setting clear goals and expectations for physicians who participate in the program , ( 4 ) demonstrating that a relatively easy program works before attempting a more complex or controversial program , and ( 5 ) sharing the gains by rewarding physicians for their time and effort supporting the program .<br />while such strategies are likely to strengthen physician support of commercial dm , they raise the broader question of the appropriate role for each player in supporting chronic dm<br />some view commercial dm companies as filling a gap in our acute care focused delivery system that has consistently failed to deliver high - quality care to those with chronic illnesses .<br />however , the flaws of a third - party work - around are evident in the increased fragmentation of care that results from a lack of coordination between dm vendors and traditional care delivery settings .<br />a compelling alternative is wagner 's chronic care model that includes a primary care - based medical home .<br />proponents of this model believe that the primary care team is the entity best suited to deliver chronic care management ( geyman , 2007 ) .<br />in this model<br />, the primary care physician leads a team of specialists , nurses , dieticians , pharmacists , and health educators to provide and coordinate all the care for a chronically ill population .<br />with evidence of cost reduction and quality improvement from group health cooperative and kaiser permanente , primary case - based dm enjoys empirical support ( mcculloch et al . , 2000 ) .<br />recent pay - for - performance programs that attempt to align payment incentives with high - quality chronic care also reflect a belief that chronic care is the responsibility of physicians and the systems in which they operate ( rosenthal et al . , 2007 ) .<br />the current commercial dm model has shortcomings within each program component that severely limit the short - term medical cost savings that can be achieved .<br />by relying on claims data<br />, individuals at risk for a near - term hospitalization can not be accurately identified .<br />behavior change specialists and physicians are not actively engaged to support recruitment and intervention efforts .<br />finally , participants are contacted too infrequently to detect impending acute episodes .<br />while there are few easy solutions to address the flaws in this model , there are several evidence - based changes that could be implemented to increase the likelihood of achieving short - term medical cost savings .<br />these include : ( 1 ) drawing on clinical data and health risk assessments for patient identification and risk stratification ; ( 2 ) using behavior change experts in conjunction with patient and physician incentives for enrollment , participation , and retention ; and ( 3 ) tailoring the intervention to the risk level of the participant with the participants at highest risk for a near - term admission receiving daily monitoring via rtm as well as monthly medication reviews , quarterly process reminders , and seasonal interventions .<br />it is critical that changes be made to all dm program components as they are interdependent ; improving identification will only lead to medical cost savings if the enrollment process and interventions are properly designed .<br />however , making the model more robust could substantially increase the cost of implementing the program , increasing the medical cost savings required to deliver net savings .<br />placing this discussion in the context of mhs , at the conclusion of phase i cms will have to determine whether to authorize a second phase .<br />along with an assessment of beneficiary and provider satisfaction , process improvements , and health outcomes , cms will assess the financial outcomes .<br />the results of a simple nnd calculation suggest that , on average , a dm vendor participating in the mhs demonstration would have to reduce all - cause hospitalizations by about 15 percent to break even on fees alone .<br />if dm can only impact congestive heart failure and diabetes ( the primary and secondary conditions targeted by mhs ) , the percentage decrease in hospitalizations needed to achieve the cost savings target lies closer to the 82-percent reduction estimate .<br />the mhs interim report reflected few statistical or substantive differences in the rate of hospitalizations , 30-day readmissions , and emergency room visits between the intervention and control group after 6 months .<br />thus , in light of the dm model flaws , achieving a 15-percent reduction in all - cause admissions or an 82-percent reduction in disease - specific admissions is unlikely for the current programs .<br />if vendors implement the changes previously discussed , a sufficient reduction in hospitalizations may be achieved before the final mhs evaluation is conducted .<br />however , this will require further investment in the interventions on top of the current monthly fees that range from $ 74 to $ 159 per beneficiary ( mccall , cromwell , and bernard , 2007 ) .<br />thus the question remains as to whether commercial dm can achieve net cost savings in the chronically ill population .<br />ultimately cms will have to assess the potential for commercial dm to be more cost effective than alternative approaches currently under study in other demonstration projects in deciding how to proceed with managing the chronically ill .", "summary": "<pad> this article describes the characteristics of the commercial disease management ( dm ) model that limits its ability to achieve short -

50% ) and negligible potential for distant metastases ( 010% ) .<br />in contrast<br />, subcutaneous leiomyosarcomas may develop local recurrence in about 4060% and distant metastasis in 2060% of patients .<br />a wide local excision with a 35 cm margin is usually an effective treatment for pcl .<br />, pcl is a rare entity that must be borne in mind when encountered with a malignant spindle cell neoplasm of the skin and usually requires a panel of immunohistochemical markers to distinguish it from other cutaneous malignancies with spindle cell morphology .", "summary": "<pad> primary cutaneous leio myosarcoma is a rare malignant tumor that accounts for only 510% of soft tissue sar Comas. it is a very rare subtype with only one case reported in the literature. here we report a 70-year old male patient who presented with a painful swelling in the right leg and was found to have a spindle cells neoplasm. histopathologically, the lesion was composed of a dermal, nodular and fibrillary neoplasm and mitosis was evident. histopathologically, the tumor cells showed strong immunostaining for vimentin and muscles -

compression - only was associated to increased survival at hospital discharge ( 211/1842 [ 11.5% ] vs 178/1895 [ 9.4% ] , rr=1.24 [ 1.01 - 1.54 ] , p=0.04 ) ( figure 2 ) .<br />forest plot for the comparison of standard cpr vs compression - only cpr on hospital survival after cardiopulmonary resuscitation .<br />similar results were obtained at sensitivity analyses using random - effect methods or risk differences ( all p<0.05 ) .<br />only one study   considered the favourable neurological outcome suggesting better outcome in clinical subgroups of patients receiving chest - compression - only .<br />available evidence from randomized controlled trials strongly supports the superiority of bystander - initiated compression - only cpr , given that patients who experienced out - of - hospital cardiac arrest could be saved by limiting cpr to chest compression .<br />these results are crucial to significantly improve the first response to out - of - hospital cardiac arrests , a worldwide major public health problem .<br />previous findings from observational studies in humans   documented that spontaneously performed ( i.e. , not dispatcher instructed ) compression - only cpr was as effective as standard cpr .<br />in the sos - kanto study , including witnessed cardiac arrests , compression - only cpr resulted in a higher proportion of patients with a favourable neurological outcome than standard cpr in patients with apnoea , shockable rhythm and resuscitation started within 4 minutes ; ventilations did not add benefits in any subgroup .<br />on the contrary , two recent nationwide observational studies   conducted in japan concluded that standard cpr should be preferred in out - of - hospital cardiac arrests of noncardiac origin , both in adults and in children ; in this group , the two cpr techniques were similarly effective for arrests of cardiac origin .<br />among the tree randomized controlled studies included in this meta - analysis , only one study   included paediatric patients < 8 years old , but results of this subgroup were not separately reported ; the study by rea et coworkers reported a tendency towards a worse efficacy of compression - only cpr than standard cpr in cardiac arrests of noncardiac origin , and a tendency towards a better efficacy in shockable rhythm and in rapid ( < 6 minutes ) response by the emergency medical system<br />.<br />the results of the present meta - analysis are consistent with the most recent observational study on 4415 cardiac arrests not due to trauma or asphyxia , drug overdose or drowning , in which a 5-years data collection was accompanied by a statewide public education campaign aimed to increase bystander compression - only cpr .<br />in this study ,<br />the incidence of bystander - initiated cpr increased every year , as did the proportion of compression - only cpr ; more importantly , overall survival increased significantly over time .<br />overall survival to hospital discharge was equal between the no bystander cpr and the standard cpr groups , while survival and neurological outcome were significantly better in the compression - only cpr group ; compression - only cpr resulted particularly effective when the cardiac arrest was witnessed and presented with a shockable rhythm .<br />in 1128<br />patients with cardiac arrest of presumed noncardiac origin , not included in the study , survival was lower and not different among the two technique and no bystander cpr .<br />it is well documented that both interruptions of chest compressions during ventilation and positive -pressure ventilations have detrimental effects on survival rate .<br />oxygenation and ventilation could be allowed - at least initially- by passive ventilation during chest compressions , by spontaneous gasping and by the lungs capacity to act as a reservoir   in addition , compression - only cpr is easier to teach , to remember and to perform , and it does not require mouth - to - mouth contact , so resulting in a better willingness to start cpr by bystanders .<br />it is worth noting that in two of the three analyzed studies   bystanders randomly assigned to standard cpr were significantly more likely to withhold cpr than callers assigned to compression - only group .<br />based on our findings , compression - only cpr should be considered as the preferred bystander cpr technique , even if ventilations still have a crucial role in cardiac arrests of presumed noncardiac origin , in children   and when resuscitation is started more than 4 minutes after the arrest . .<br />however , it should be considered that most victims of cardiac arrest are adults , and the cause is cardiac in about 2/3 of cases .<br />the importance of ventilations in cardiac arrests lasting more than 3 - 4 minutes is more controversial , as two recent studies in a porcine models reported contradictory results .<br />likely laypersons training on cpr should be simplified to privilege compression - only cpr ; in 2008 the american heart association already recommended that untrained bystanders should provide compression - only cpr for adults with sudden cardiac arrest .<br />however , fatigue can be a relevant problem decreasing the quality of compressions and a change of cpr providers every one minute instead of every two minutes has been suggested .<br />available evidence from randomized controlled trials suggests that compression - only cpr is superior to standard cpr at least when performed by untrained bystander .<br />these results have relevant implications on teaching , and if adequately publicized they should favour a crucial increase in the rate of bystanders performed cpr .", "summary": "<pad> objective : to evaluate the efficacy of out -

third of the population ) and was subsequently introduced to other islands of the indian ocean and continental india , via the vector a.albopictus [ 1 , 57 , 12 ] .<br />it is believed that the 2007 outbreak in italy was initiated through the importation of the chikv by a traveler from reunion island .<br />other countries in which international travel facilitated the spread of chikv included france ( from travelers from reunion island ; 77% ) , comoros ( 14% ) , and mauritius ( 9% ) .<br />autochthonous transmission in france , however , was not detected until the year 2010 , in association with a. albopictus .<br />studies have reported a high efficiency of transmission of chikv in the temperate climates by the a. albopictus species .<br />there are several aedes species which are competent in the transmission of the chikv , with a.aegypti and emerging populations of a.albopictus identified as responsible vectors in asia .<br />the asian strain identified in thailand in 1958 was transmitted by the suspected vector , a. aegypti .<br />this asian strain was also reported in outbreaks in india ( 19621965 ) and southeast asia ( 19581960 and 19621964 ) , also in association with the a. aegypti mosquito .<br />epidemics of the 1980s and 1990s in southeast asian countries ( philippines , thailand , myanmar , and indonesia ) were associated with the asian endemic / epidemic chikv lineage . since then<br />, the asian endemic / epidemic chikv lineage has continued to circulate sporadically , transmitted primarily among humans by a.aegypti and was again documented in the 2006 outbreak in malaysia [ 1 , 7 ] .<br />emergence of an iol strain with resulting replacement of the endemic asian strain occurred during the southeast asia epidemics of 20062009 [ 1 , 7 ] .<br />it is thought that the e1 envelope glycoprotein mutation of the endemic asian genotype resulted in the decreased adaptability of the chikv to a.albopictus , with decreased transmission , and the facilitation of chikv evolution and strain replacement .<br />the caribbean region continues to encounter challenges with the control of mosquito populations including a.aegypti and other aedes species .<br />the aedes mosquito was introduced to the caribbean through the african slave trade .<br />following its introduction ,<br />a significant increase in the a. aegypti population density was associated with the intercontinental exchange activities of the second world war .<br />public health interventions of national health ministries and the pan american health organization in the 1950s and 1960s successfully reduced a.aegypti vector indexes by 1972 .<br />this success , however , was short lived and the re - infestations of the latin american and caribbean regions by a.aegypti in the late 1970s was accompanied by the introduction of a.albopictus in the early 1980s to some caribbean countries .<br />although both a.aegypti and a.albopictus may be found in the caribbean , a.aegypti remains the principal vector responsible for the transmission of chikv and dengue in this region .<br />to date<br />, the chikv lineage identified in the 2014 caribbean outbreak belongs to the old asian lineage .<br />the presence of the asian lineage chikv , compounded by a nave caribbean population and high prevalence of a.aegypti , makes the probability of establishment of endemicity of chikungunya in the caribbean high .<br />this risk of establishment of endemicity extends to most tropical and subtropical regions of latin america areas and the southern usa , which is presently experiencing challenges with a.aegypti re - infestation .<br />in the months preceding the caribbean s first case , china and the philippines accounted for 27.5% of travelers into the caribbean .<br />there were ten cases reported in spain from travelers from haiti and dominica republic during april to june 2014 .<br />the expansion of the chikv to north and south america from the caribbean is of great concern .<br />in their review of air travel from the caribbean , noted that the final destination of 52.1% of international travelers from the chikungunya - infected caribbean territories was the usa .<br />the most likely cities to be travelled to from the caribbean were new york ( 13.8% ) , paris ( 11.7% ) , miami ( 7.8% ) and san juan , puerto rico ( 3.9% ) .<br />it is expected that the change of climatic conditions , compounded by the increase of the warmer weather in temperate zones , will facilitate the further spread of this disease .<br />the months june through to november are designated as the  hurricane season  in the caribbean , or  the wet season  .<br />the wet season has been shown to be associated with the increased breeding of the a.aegypti mosquitos .<br />florida reported its first two cases of autochthonous chikv transmission in july 2014 and , as of september 9 , 2014 , remains the only us state with autochthonous transmission .<br />florida now has eight cases of local transmission and 184 travel - associated laboratory - confirmed chikungunya cases as reported to arbornet .<br />the impact of the introduction of chikv into the caribbean region , a known tourist destination exchange of an estimated 20 million persons annually of which 9 million are us residents , remains to be seen .<br />the acquisition of chikv by travelers to the caribbean enhances the spread to neighboring caribbean countries and globally .<br />as of epidemiological week 35 , among the caribbean countries affected , those with the highest incidence rates ( incidence/100,000 population ) include : guadeloupe ( 16,465 ) , martinique ( 15,087 ) , saint martin ( french part 13,401 ) , saint barthelemy ( 11,707 ) , dominica ( 5,068 ) , dominican republic ( 4,128 ) , and haiti ( 627 ) ( fig .<br />1 ) .<br />the emergence of chikungunya in the caribbean unfolds a story of the dynamic evolution and interaction of microbes and risk factors underlying the determinants of health .<br />the interaction of economic trade and its role in the transmission of vectors and infectious agents needs to be reviewed and policies reinforced and implemented .<br />.<br />continued education to increase the awareness of this disease is needed to curtail the population growth of mosquitoes and to mitigate the spread of chikungunya by travelers to the usa and other regions .<br />improved awareness of the epidemiology and clinical manifestations<br />preventative measures and epidemiological monitoring of the evolving chikv epidemic in the caribbean must be improved and sustained .<br />this article does not contain any new studies with human or animal subjects performed by any of the authors .<br />lizette mowatt and sandra t. jackson have no conflict of interest to declare with respect to this article .<br />this article does not contain any new studies with human or animal subjects performed by any of the authors .<br />this article is distributed under the terms of the creative commons attribution noncommercial license which permits any noncommercial use , distribution , and reproduction in any medium , provided the original author(s ) and the source are credited .", "summary": "<pad> in 2014, the caribbean outbreak was diagnosed in 2013 and has occurred in the usa and the united states within 9 months. this is the first case of autochthonously transmission of chikung unya virus in the usa and the americas in 2014. this is the first reported case of autochthonously transmission of chikUNGunya virus in the usa and the united states. improved awareness of epidemiology and clinical manifestation preventative measures is needed to curtail population growth of mosquitoeses and to mitigate the spread by travelers to the united states and other regions."}, "article_18_bigbird_pegasus": {"source_doc": "american cutaneus leishmaniasis ( acl ) is a vector - borne zoonotic disease caused by several species of leishmania trypanosome protozoan parasites and transmitted by phlebotomine sandflies ( lutzomyia spp . ) .<br />in brazil<br />, acl constitutes a significant health problem , with an incidence of about 20,153 new cases per year ( 2008 ) .<br />in humans ,<br />infections may not be readily apparent but can present a variety of clinical manifestations ranging from localised , sometimes self - healing cutaneous lesions to severe mutilating mucocutaneous lesions or diffuse cutaneous leishmaniasis .<br />a high prevalence of infection has been reported in pernambuco state , northeastern brazil , concentrated predominantly in the atlantic forest region ; transmission has increased dramatically in recent decades [ 3 , 4 ] .<br />many different patterns of acl etiology have been described in brazil , particularly in highly endemic regions .<br />acl was originally considered to be focused among people who work or live within tropical forests ; however , comparison of this idea with current patterns of occurrence suggests strongly that behavior of vectors may be changing , perhaps in response to environmental shifts [ 1 , 6 , 7 ] .<br />numerous studies point to the capacity of some lutzomyia species to adapt to human - altered environments in parts of brazil [ 1 , 810 ] , which opens possibilities for broader and much increased transmission .<br />the sandflies lutzomyia whitmani and l. migonei are considered important acl vectors in brazil that have generally been found in peridomestic environments in southeastern ( states of so paulo , minas gerais , esprito santo , rio de janeiro )<br />[ 1113 ] , northeastern ( maranho , bahia , cear , pernambuco )<br />[ 1416 ] , and west - central ( mato grosso , mato grosso do sul , tocantins ) regions [ 10 , 1719 ] .<br />lutzomyia intermedia , on the other hand , dominates and is considered the principal acl vector in areas of so paulo , rio de janeiro , and minas gerais [ 1 , 11 , 12 ] .<br />various factors have been identified as key in this domiciliation process , including climatic factors ( annual and seasonal temperature and precipitation ) , vegetation type , and elevation , as well as socioeconomic conditions that may influence risk of transmission to humans [ 20 , 21 ] .<br />finally , lutzomyia whitmani ranks among the most important acl vectors in brazil   and has been found to be abundant in atlantic forest areas in pernambuco since at least the 1990s [ 4 , 16 ] .<br />this species has been found to be infected naturally with leishmania ( viannia ) braziliensis in this region , forming a key element in the zoonotic transmission cycle of this pathogen [ 23 , 24 ] .<br />the purpose of this study is to analyze the  behavior  in terms of distribution and population trends through time and across space of lutzomyia species in a long - term focus of acl transmission in the state of pernambuco , brazil .<br />given that l. whitmani dominates the sandfly fauna in this region almost absolutely , we focus on this species , as it clearly drives much of the dynamics of the system .<br />we explore this species in relation to various environmental factors in amaraj , pernambuco , an area of intermingled atlantic forest and farmland that is of particular interest as regards high acl transmission [ 3 , 24 ] .<br />during the course of 2009 , sandflies were collected in the municipality of amaraj , an atlantic forest - dominated locality just inland from the coast of pernambuco .<br />specifically , we collected at the small , rural settlements of refrigerio and tranquilidade ( 82259s 352709w , 289  m ; figure 1 ) .<br />the sampling covered 9 months of 2009 ( january , february , march , april , june , august , october , november ) .<br />we used 10 cdc light traps   per night on 3 - 4 nights , for a total of 255 trap - nights over the course of the study .<br />one cdc light trap inside domiciles , and four in peridomicile ( including animal shelters ) , and five in nearby forested areas .<br />the traps were positioned 1.5  m above the ground on the edges of banana plantations or atlantic forest fragments , in the interior of forest fragments , and around human domiciles and associated structures ( stables , granaries , etc . ) .<br />each site was visited every second month , and the two sets of sites were sampled in alternating sets of months to maximize numbers of sites included in the study .<br />an initial analysis of temporal dimensions sandfly abundance in this study has already been published .<br />the location of each trap was georeferenced using a hand - held garmin ( etrex hc series ) global positioning unit , accurate to ~10<br />m on the ground using the datum wgs 1984 .<br />the species lutzomyia whitmani was analyzed separately from the other species occurring in the area because of its near - absolute dominance among the sandfly fauna of the region .<br />we used chi - squared tests to compare relative frequencies of different species in different environments , both in terms of numbers of individuals captured and numbers of sites at which the species were collected .<br />we compared l. whitmani with the remaining lutzomyia species except as constrained by sample sizes for the latter species ( expected frequencies had to be 5 for tests to be possible ) .<br />all statistical tests were based on an  = 0.05 .<br />to summarize dimensions of land cover and vegetation characteristics and phenology , we calculated the normalized difference vegetation index ( ndvi ) from landsat images available from the u.s .<br />geological survey ( http://glovis.usgs.gov/ ) with spatial resolution of 30  m ( 98  ft ) .<br />specifically , we used images from the enhanced thematic mapper-7 sensor for the following dates : 3 october and 21 october 2006 , 15 april 2007 , and 8 august 2009 , which were the most cloud - free images available over the period 20062009 .<br />to calculate ndvi<br />, we used the formula 10,000[(b40  b30)/(b40 + b30 ) ] , where b40 and b30 represent the red and near - infrared bands from the landsat images , respectively . to identify environmental conditions under which lutzomyia species occur in the amaraj region , we used ecological niche modeling ( enm ) routines implemented in maxent . in general<br />, we used default parameters to train models , so that we set the random testing percentage to 50% to provide an independent perspective on model quality ; we focused on the logistic output format . to identify environmental parameters most relevant to the species ' occurrence<br />, we used a jackknife procedure that measures effects of each environment variable alone and when omitted from the model on predictions [ 27 , 28 ] .<br />to separate areas predicted as suitable from those predicted as unsuitable , we set the expected meaningful error parameter of peterson et al .<br />we used as a threshold for separating prediction of suitability from prediction of unsuitability the highest logistic maxent suitability value that included ( 100e)% , in this case 98% of the training data , to take into account the possible presence of noise in the input data .<br />to provide a quantitative test of model predictions ,<br />we were forced to focus on a subset of the study area , for which no cloud cover was present in at least two of the images ( figure 1 ) .<br />to provide a clear test of predictive ability among spatial subsets , thereby avoiding some problems with spatial autocorrelation among training and testing data<br />, we separated this subset of the study region into eastern , central , and western areas and challenged models to use each pair of areas to anticipate the distribution of the species in the third area .<br />we then used a receiving operating characteristic ( roc ) approach to provide a threshold - independent evaluation of each prediction .<br />however , in light of known problems with standard roc approaches [ 31 , 32 ] , we used a partial roc approach , in which analyses are limited to portions of the roc curve in which omission error is less than or equal to e ; these tests were developed using a program developed by n. barve that is available upon request from the authors .<br />the test statistic output from these routines is the auc ratio , which compares the observed area under the curve to null expectations ; auc ratios are tested for difference from unity ( i.e. , random prediction ) via 1000 repetitions of a 50% bootstrap of available input data .<br />finally , to provide a visualization of ecological niche patterns of lutzomyia species ' distributions in the study area<br />, we developed a final niche model based on all occurrence data available across the three areas ( i.e. , no subsetting ) .<br />we combined ( grid combine in arcgis 9.3 ) this map with the environmental data layers from which it was derived to yield a raster dataset with an associated attributes table that includes the value of each combination of environmental variables ( ndvi of each time period ) and the prediction from maxent .<br />this table was exported in ascii format and used to develop various visualizations of niche patterns .<br />we identified 12 lutzomyia species in the amaraj study during 2009 , for a total of 1361 individuals across the 255 trap sites .<br />lutzomyia whitmani was by far the most abundant species , totaling 1195 individuals ( 87.8% ; table 1 ) .<br />other species recorded included l. evandroi ( 4.9% ) ,<br />l. quinquefer ( 1.9% ) , and l. complexa ( 1.3% ) , among others .<br />in peridomiciliary environments ,<br />l. whitmani was even more dominant ( 98.2% of individuals ) ;<br />l. evandroi , l. quinquefer , and l. migonei appeared to show a similar association with human - modified environments , albeit in much lower numbers .<br />in contrast , l. complexa , l. tupynambai , l. sordelli , l. longispina , and l. walkeri appeared restricted to forest and forest edge in this study ( table 1 ) .<br />the concentration of l. whitmani in peridomiciliary environments was much greater than would be expected by chance ( p < 0.05 ) ; tests for the remaining species were equivocal , probably owing to small sample sizes .<br />table 1 shows the distribution of positive sites and individuals species in forested and peridomiciliary areas . among<br />the 120 sandfly positive sites , 82 ( 68.3% ) were in peridomiciliary areas , while 38 ( 31.7% ) were detected in forested areas ( p = 0.005 ) .<br />l. whitmani and l. quinquefer were dominant in peridomestic sites ( p < 0.05 ) , as well as l. migonei ( p = 0.07 ) , while l. complexa , l. sordelli , and l. tupynambai were found almost exclusively in forested areas ( p < 0.05 ) .<br />for all other species , distribution of positive sites among peridomiciliary versus forested areas could not be determined ( p  0.05 ) .<br />l. whitmani was the most abundant species as well as the most broadly distributed across the study area .<br />relating patterns of occurrence to patterns of surface reflectance in the landsat imagery , the jackknife process indicated ndvi from october and april as the environmental variables most associated with presence of l. whitmani .<br />ndvi of march and august were omitted from models in light of their little contribution to fitness of models .<br />niche models estimated from and projected among the three regions of the study area for which cloud - free imagery was available showed good ( i.e. , better than random expectances ) coincidence with independent testing data sets ( table 2 ) .<br />in particular , for example , for l. whitmani , the model based on western and central regions predicted the distribution of the species in the eastern region with an auc ratio mean of 1.12 , which has an associated probability value of p < 0.001 .<br />the other two predictions were similarly statistically significantly better than random expectations ( table 2 ) thus amply confirming both the environmental influences on sandfly distribution and the predictive power of our models .<br />figure 2 shows the relationship between modeled distributions in environmental space of l. whitmani as opposed to the other sandfly species at amaraj , revealing differences in the distribution of species according to the vegetation index .<br />figure 3 shows adding detail regarding presences detected for l. whitmani versus other species in forested and peridomiciliary environments .<br />l. whitmani appears to be associated negatively with ndvi values ( both in april , which is the rainy season , and in october , which is the dry season ) , as areas predicted as unsuitable for this species show generally higher ndvi values ( figures 2 and 3 ) .<br />most other lutzomyia species , on the other hand , appear associated positively with denser vegetation ( i.e. , higher ndvi values ) in both seasons ( figures 3 ) .<br />overall , then , lutzomyia species ' occurrences are associated with specific environmental combinations ( with contrast among species ) in amaraj .<br />in the amaraj region as well as in other areas of brazil , lutzomyia whitmani has been implicated as the principal acl vector , predominantly associated with leishmania braziliensis , the main parasite species involved in transmission , although in southern region of the country it is considered only a secondary vector [ 3 , 13 ] .<br />in amaraj , although 12 species were detected , l. whitmani was dominant constituting 87.8% overall of detections , and 95% in peridomiciliary locations .<br />in forested areas , l. whitmani was less dominant ( only 41.7% of detections ) , and other species played more meaningful roles in the sandfly community .<br />this tie of l. whitmani to human - altered environments has been noted also in amazon basin , and in the center - west and southern parts of the country [ 10 , 11 , 14 ] .<br />however , in a nearby region of pernambuco with greater forest cover , l. whitmani was found to be a relatively unimportant member of the sandfly community , and l. complexa and l. choti were much more numerous .<br />among the other species detected at amaraj<br />, l. evandroi and l. migonei both also appeared to be concentrated in peridomiciliary environments .<br />although far less common than l. whitmani , the human association of these species makes them of some interest in acl transmission , as in other regions [ 11 , 34 , 35 ] .<br />given its domiciliation and massive dominance , l. whitmani is almost certainly the major acl vector in the region [ 24 , 36 ] .<br />while other species were rare around human habitations , this sand fly was more abundant in peridomiciliary and to a lesser degree forested areas , offering a possible vectorial role for other leishmania species in the wooded environments .<br />detection of l. whitmani in peridomestic and forested areas reinforces the assumption that deforestation does not result in decline of the species habitat but adaptation and/or tolerance of different vegetation type and climatic condition .<br />clearly , the next step in this process would be detailed analysis of ( 1 ) blood meal sources for each sandfly species in the region , ( 2 ) detection of leishmania infections in the flies , and ( 3 ) identification and association of leishmania strains in both sandflies and locally infected humans .<br />this group of information , together with our spatial data , would offer significant insight into the details of acl transmission cycle in the region .<br />predictive models relating species occurrences to abiotic variables have been used in several previous studies of distribution and ecology of vectors , reservoirs , and infectious diseases [ 10 , 21 , 37 ] .<br />most previous analyzes have been carried out at scales that are set by resolution of the available environmental variables of occurrence data [ 21 , 38 , 39 ] .<br />however , climate of the relatively small area designated in this study does not vary much over scales like this .<br />whereas the analysis of existing vegetation indirectly reflects the effects of rain and vegetation in the region , identifying ecologically disturbed and forested areas is of particular interest in the study of lutzomyia spp .<br />the amount of vegetation in the dry and wet seasons were adequate in predictions of species occurrence , particularly for l. whitmani , which could be analyzed in detail .<br />for this purpose , ndvi provides a good index of ecosystem function with strong correlation with absorbed photosynthetically active radiation .<br />in spite the fact that l. whitmani has been associated with geoecological factors , this highly anthropophilic species is also influenced by socioenvironmental changes and transformation on landscape [ 10 , 34 ] , which were not evaluated in this study .<br />there was a negative association between this species and higher ndvi values ( denser vegetation ) , and predictions of the distribution of l. whitmani among regsions were statistically significantly better than random expectations .<br />this result strongly suggests that it is feasible to predict the distribution of this important vector in regions where it is difficult to perform sampling due to factors such as difficult access and financial restrictions .", "summary": "the phlebotomine sandfly lutzomyia ( leishmania : lutzomyia spp . ) is an important human pathogen in brazil, responsible for a wide range of pathologies in humans. many studies point to environmental factors as key for the adaptation and transmission of this species. the objective of this study was to predict the occurrence of various sandfly species in response to changes in the distribution and/or intensity of human - induced environmental changes in northeastern brazil. the data were obtained from direct observation of the flies, a survey of acl - positive individuals, and analyses of ecological niche modeling. we found species with the capacity to adapt to changing environmental conditions, including l. whitmani in the atlantic forest regions of pernambuco ( northeastern brazil ). we also found species with the capacity to adapt to changes in human -

free images available over the period 20062009 .<br />to calculate ndvi<br />, we used the formula 10,000[(b40  b30)/(b40 + b30 ) ] , where b40 and b30 represent the red and near - infrared bands from the landsat images , respectively . to identify environmental conditions under which lutzomyia species occur in the amaraj region , we used ecological niche modeling ( enm ) routines implemented in maxent . in general<br />, we used default parameters to train models , so that we set the random testing percentage to 50% to provide an independent perspective on model quality ; we focused on the logistic output format . to identify environmental parameters most relevant to the species ' occurrence<br />, we used a jackknife procedure that measures effects of each environment variable alone and when omitted from the model on predictions [ 27 , 28 ] .<br />to separate areas predicted as suitable from those predicted as unsuitable , we set the expected meaningful error parameter of peterson et al .<br />we used as a threshold for separating prediction of suitability from prediction of unsuitability the highest logistic maxent suitability value that included ( 100e)% , in this case 98% of the training data , to take into account the possible presence of noise in the input data .<br />to provide a quantitative test of model predictions ,<br />we were forced to focus on a subset of the study area , for which no cloud cover was present in at least two of the images ( figure 1 ) .<br />to provide a clear test of predictive ability among spatial subsets , thereby avoiding some problems with spatial autocorrelation among training and testing data<br />, we separated this subset of the study region into eastern , central , and western areas and challenged models to use each pair of areas to anticipate the distribution of the species in the third area .<br />we then used a receiving operating characteristic ( roc ) approach to provide a threshold - independent evaluation of each prediction .<br />however , in light of known problems with standard roc approaches [ 31 , 32 ] , we used a partial roc approach , in which analyses are limited to portions of the roc curve in which omission error is less than or equal to e ; these tests were developed using a program developed by n. barve that is available upon request from the authors .<br />the test statistic output from these routines is the auc ratio , which compares the observed area under the curve to null expectations ; auc ratios are tested for difference from unity ( i.e. , random prediction ) via 1000 repetitions of a 50% bootstrap of available input data .<br />finally , to provide a visualization of ecological niche patterns of lutzomyia species ' distributions in the study area<br />, we developed a final niche model based on all occurrence data available across the three areas ( i.e. , no subsetting ) .<br />we combined ( grid combine in arcgis 9.3 ) this map with the environmental data layers from which it was derived to yield a raster dataset with an associated attributes table that includes the value of each combination of environmental variables ( ndvi of each time period ) and the prediction from maxent .<br />this table was exported in ascii format and used to develop various visualizations of niche patterns .<br />we identified 12 lutzomyia species in the amaraj study during 2009 , for a total of 1361 individuals across the 255 trap sites .<br />lutzomyia whitmani was by far the most abundant species , totaling 1195 individuals ( 87.8% ; table 1 ) .<br />other species recorded included l. evandroi ( 4.9% ) ,<br />l. quinquefer ( 1.9% ) , and l. complexa ( 1.3% ) , among others .<br />in peridomiciliary environments ,<br />l. whitmani was even more dominant ( 98.2% of individuals ) ;<br />l. evandroi , l. quinquefer , and l. migonei appeared to show a similar association with human - modified environments , albeit in much lower numbers .<br />in contrast , l. complexa , l. tupynambai , l. sordelli , l. longispina , and l. walkeri appeared restricted to forest and forest edge in this study ( table 1 ) .<br />the concentration of l. whitmani in peridomiciliary environments was much greater than would be expected by chance ( p < 0.05 ) ; tests for the remaining species were equivocal , probably owing to small sample sizes .<br />table 1 shows the distribution of positive sites and individuals species in forested and peridomiciliary areas . among<br />the 120 sandfly positive sites , 82 ( 68.3% ) were in peridomiciliary areas , while 38 ( 31.7% ) were detected in forested areas ( p = 0.005 ) .<br />l. whitmani and l. quinquefer were dominant in peridomestic sites ( p < 0.05 ) , as well as l. migonei ( p = 0.07 ) , while l. complexa , l. sordelli , and l. tupynambai were found almost exclusively in forested areas ( p < 0.05 ) .<br />for all other species , distribution of positive sites among peridomiciliary versus forested areas could not be determined ( p  0.05 ) .<br />l. whitmani was the most abundant species as well as the most broadly distributed across the study area .<br />relating patterns of occurrence to patterns of surface reflectance in the landsat imagery , the jackknife process indicated ndvi from october and april as the environmental variables most associated with presence of l. whitmani .<br />ndvi of march and august were omitted from models in light of their little contribution to fitness of models .<br />niche models estimated from and projected among the three regions of the study area for which cloud - free imagery was available showed good ( i.e. , better than random expectances ) coincidence with independent testing data sets ( table 2 ) .<br />in particular , for example , for l. whitmani , the model based on western and central regions predicted the distribution of the species in the eastern region with an auc ratio mean of 1.12 , which has an associated probability value of p < 0.001 .<br />the other two predictions were similarly statistically significantly better than random expectations ( table 2 ) thus amply confirming both the environmental influences on sandfly distribution and the predictive power of our models .<br />figure 2 shows the relationship between modeled distributions in environmental space of l. whitmani as opposed to the other sandfly species at amaraj , revealing differences in the distribution of species according to the vegetation index .<br />figure 3 shows adding detail regarding presences detected for l. whitmani versus other species in forested and peridomiciliary environments .<br />l. whitmani appears to be associated negatively with ndvi values ( both in april , which is the rainy season , and in october , which is the dry season ) , as areas predicted as unsuitable for this species show generally higher ndvi values ( figures 2 and 3 ) .<br />most other lutzomyia species , on the other hand , appear associated positively with denser vegetation ( i.e. , higher ndvi values ) in both seasons ( figures 3 ) .<br />overall , then , lutzomyia species ' occurrences are associated with specific environmental combinations ( with contrast among species ) in amaraj .<br />in the amaraj region as well as in other areas of brazil , lutzomyia whitmani has been implicated as the principal acl vector , predominantly associated with leishmania braziliensis , the main parasite species involved in transmission , although in southern region of the country it is considered only a secondary vector [ 3 , 13 ] .<br />in amaraj , although 12 species were detected , l. whitmani was dominant constituting 87.8% overall of detections , and 95% in peridomiciliary locations .<br />in forested areas , l. whitmani was less dominant ( only 41.7% of detections ) , and other species played more meaningful roles in the sandfly community .<br />this tie of l. whitmani to human - altered environments has been noted also in amazon basin , and in the center - west and southern parts of the country [ 10 , 11 , 14 ] .<br />however , in a nearby region of pernambuco with greater forest cover , l. whitmani was found to be a relatively unimportant member of the sandfly community , and l. complexa and l. choti were much more numerous .<br />among the other species detected at amaraj<br />, l. evandroi and l. migonei both also appeared to be concentrated in peridomiciliary environments .<br />although far less common than l. whitmani , the human association of these species makes them of some interest in acl transmission , as in other regions [ 11 , 34 , 35 ] .<br />given its domiciliation and massive dominance , l. whitmani is almost certainly the major acl vector in the region [ 24 , 36 ] .<br />while other species were rare around human habitations , this sand fly was more abundant in peridomiciliary and to a lesser degree forested areas , offering a possible vectorial role for other leishmania species in the wooded environments .<br />detection of l. whitmani in peridomestic and forested areas reinforces the assumption that deforestation does not result in decline of the species habitat but adaptation and/or tolerance of different vegetation type and climatic condition .<br />clearly , the next step in this process would be detailed analysis of ( 1 ) blood meal sources for each sandfly species in the region , ( 2 ) detection of leishmania infections in the flies , and ( 3 ) identification and association of leishmania strains in both sandflies and locally infected humans .<br />this group of information , together with our spatial data , would offer significant insight into the details of acl transmission cycle in the region .<br />predictive models relating species occurrences to abiotic variables have been used in several previous studies of distribution and ecology of vectors , reservoirs , and infectious diseases [ 10 , 21 , 37 ] .<br />most previous analyzes have been carried out at scales that are set by resolution of the available environmental variables of occurrence data [ 21 , 38 , 39 ] .<br />however , climate of the relatively small area designated in this study does not vary much over scales like this .<br />whereas the analysis of existing vegetation indirectly reflects the effects of rain and vegetation in the region , identifying ecologically disturbed and forested areas is of particular interest in the study of lutzomyia spp .<br />the amount of vegetation in the dry and wet seasons were adequate in predictions of species occurrence , particularly for l. whitmani , which could be analyzed in detail .<br />for this purpose , ndvi provides a good index of ecosystem function with strong correlation with absorbed photosynthetically active radiation .<br />in spite the fact that l. whitmani has been associated with geoecological factors , this highly anthropophilic species is also influenced by socioenvironmental changes and transformation on landscape [ 10 , 34 ] , which were not evaluated in this study .<br />there was a negative association between this species and higher ndvi values ( denser vegetation ) , and predictions of the distribution of l. whitmani among regsions were statistically significantly better than random expectations .<br />this result strongly suggests that it is feasible to predict the distribution of this important vector in regions where it is difficult to perform sampling due to factors such as difficult access and financial restrictions .", "summary": "the purpose of this study is to analyze the spatial distribution and population trends through time of lutzomyia species in a long -

altered environments in parts of brazil [ 1 , 810 ] , which opens possibilities for broader and much increased transmission .<br />the sandflies lutzomyia whitmani and l. migonei are considered important acl vectors in brazil that have generally been found in peridomestic environments in southeastern ( states of so paulo , minas gerais , esprito santo , rio de janeiro )<br />[ 1113 ] , northeastern ( maranho , bahia , cear , pernambuco )<br />[ 1416 ] , and west -

like gpcrs <br /> ( reviewed in ref ( 6 ) ) and a gpcr - g protein complex , provided <br /> breakthrough insights about the structural basis for signal transduction <br /> through these 7-tm helical proteins .<br />however , the present lack of <br /> a mechanistic understanding , at the molecular level , of the events <br /> that lead to in meso crystallization of membrane <br /> proteins , makes the success of the method somewhat enigmatic and results <br /> in the need for extensive trials to identify specific conditions , <br /> that is , the host and additive lipid , precipitant etc .<br />such in meso trials begin with the target<br />protein <br /> being reconstituted into the lcp , and a hypothetical descriptive mechanism <br /> based on the membrane curvature and hydrophobic mismatch has been <br /> proposed to address <br /> the crucial step during in meso crystallization  the <br /> preferential partitioning of proteins from the lcp to the lamellar <br /> phase .<br />in the original trials ,<br />the lipid used to form the lcp was <br /> monoolein ( 9.9 mag , see figure 1a ) , however <br /> recent experiments have utilized shorter chain analogs of monoolein <br /> as well as mixtures of monoolein with cholesterol ( see refs ( 12 , 18,21)and citations <br /> therein ) .<br />the reconstituted proteins appear to be well - accommodated , <br /> functional , and mobile inside the lcp where they are believed to reside <br /> largely in a monomeric state .<br />the addition of a precipitant <br /> of suitable composition , which is <br /> the next step in the in meso trial , is proposed to <br /> result in local structural and compositional changes in the mesophase <br /> and likely in protein conformation as well , which alter the interactions between the <br /> proteins and the cubic phase lipid bilayer ; ultimately this drives <br /> the preferential partitioning of the proteins into the lamellar phase <br /> that presumably appears within the lcp .<br />the critical aspect of the nucleation and subsequent crystal growth <br /> process that is triggered in this manner , and ultimately determines <br /> the quality of the grown crystals , is that once they have diffused <br /> from the lcp to the lamellar phase the proteins form tight 3d oligomeric <br /> arrays .<br />the oligomerization of <br /> tm proteins in lipid bilayers has generally <br /> been suggested to involve the hydrophobic mismatch effects originating <br /> from the difference in the lengths of the hydrophobic core of the <br /> protein and the surrounding lipid hydrocarbon region .<br />such mismatch effects have been shown from experiments to play a <br /> role not only in the spatial organization but also in the function <br /> of tm proteins , such as the gpcr rhodopsin .<br />the hydrophobic mismatch is considered to drive the membrane to <br /> deform in order to alleviate the energetically unfavorable hydrophilic / hydrophobic <br /> exposure this mismatch entails .<br />when such membrane deformation can not <br /> achieve a complete hydrophobic adaptation , the  residual exposure  <br /> ( or  residual mismatch  ) to unfavorable interactions <br /> gives rise to an unfavorable contribution to the free energy of protein / membrane <br /> interaction .<br />the mitigation of this energy <br /> term through oligomerization has been suggested as an important mechanistic <br /> contribution to membrane - driven oligomerization of multihelical tm <br /> proteins , such as gpcrs , in lipid bilayers .<br />therefore , we investigated the potential role of differential hydrophobic <br /> exposure of such proteins in lipid bilayers of the cubic and lamellar <br /> phases as a possible determinant of the favorable outcome of in meso crystallization trials .<br />here<br />we present the <br /> results of a molecular dynamics - based study <br /> of a gpcr reconstituted into an lcp environment that reveal differences <br /> in the hydrophobic / hydrophilic exposure of the gpcr to lipid <br />the quantitative results <br /> reflect the drive for differential oligomerization behavior of these <br /> proteins in the two lipid environments that essentially define the <br /> end points along the in meso crystallization pathway .<br />with the ability to connect quantitatively the difference in gpcr <br /> oligomerization behavior in the two different media , to the curvature <br /> and mismatch alleviation capabilities of the two environments ,<br />we <br /> are able to predict lipid types that would enhance / diminish the difference <br /> in the residual exposure for a gpcr in the cubic and lamellar phases .<br />given the recognized importance of protein <br />membrane interaction <br /> for the functional properties of gpcrs , molecular dynamics simulation <br /> studies using all - atom and coarse - grained representations have been carried out for the prototypical gpcr , <br /> rhodopsin , in lamellar membranes .<br />to our knowledge<br />the present work <br /> is the first molecular dynamics - based study of a gpcr reconstituted <br /> into the lcp .<br />the results enable quantitative inferences about the <br /> energetically unfavorable hydrophobic  hydrophilic interactions <br /> that differentiate the behaviors of gpcrs in the two different lipid <br /> environments , lcp and lamellar membranes .<br />we attain these insights <br /> from comparative microsecond time - scale coarse - grained simulations <br /> with the martini force - field of rhodopsin in monoolein - based <br /> cubic and lamellar lipid bilayers .<br />using our recently reported computational <br /> framework for quantifying residual mismatch energies from md trajectories<br />, we evaluated the protein - dependent membrane <br /> deformations and their attendant energy cost , and identified specific <br /> tm regions and residues of rhodopsin that exhibit differential hydrophobic <br /> exposure in the lcp and lamellar bilayers .<br />we show that the bilayer <br /> of the lcp more efficiently shields the protein from unfavorable interactions , <br /> and that the reduced level of hydrophobic mismatch in the lcp is attributable <br /> to the specific , highly curved geometry of the cubic phase .<br />better <br /> protection from unfavorable hydrophobic exposure of rhodopsin in the <br /> lcp phase is especially evident for residues in tm helix 1 ( tmh1 ) <br /> and tmh5 .<br />lcp environment , the planar bilayer of the lamellar phase provides <br /> a more favorable setting for gpcr oligomerization as a prelude to <br /> nucleation and crystal growth .<br />thus , our findings provide novel energy - based <br /> insights into driving elements of in meso crystallization <br /> mechanisms and lay the foundation for future quantitative exploration <br /> of rational approaches for the generation of structure - quality crystals <br /> of membrane proteins .<br />coarse - grained ( cg ) md simulations of the lipid <br /> cubic phases ( lcp ) with or without rhodopsin were done with the martini <br /> force field , grouping atoms into coarse - grained <br /> beads ( see figure 1a ) , and the gromacs 3.3.1 <br /> package as listed for the various molecular <br /> constructs in table 1 . as a host lipid for <br /> the lcp , we used monoolein ( 9.9 mag ) which consists of an 18 carbon <br /> fatty acid with a cis double bond between carbons <br /> 9 and 10 in ester linkage to the primary hydroxyl of glycerol ( figure 1a ) .<br />simulation times reported are effective <br /> times , taking into consideration typical for martini force - field based <br /> coarse - grained simulations factor of 4 .<br />simulations with protein were initiated <br /> from self - assembled lipid diamond cubic phase of 500 lipids by replicating <br /> the monoolein / water system 27 times ( 3 times in positive and negative x , y , z directions ) and inserting rhodopsin randomly into <br /> the expanded lcp phase .<br />in the first phase of the study<br />, we conducted extensive self - assembly <br /> simulations of randomly mixed cg 9.9 mag lipids and water molecules <br /> into a lipidic diamond cubic phase .<br />as listed in table 1 and detailed in the results , the diamond lipid phase was <br /> successfully achieved in multiple simulations conducted at 20 c <br /> temperature and 40% ( w / w ) water weight percent .<br />all the self - assembly <br /> simulations ( see table 1 ) were initiated from <br /> a random placement of 500 cg 9.9 mags ( a number that is within the <br /> experimentally determined range of 9.9 mag molecules in the unit cell <br /> of the diamond cubic phase ) , and a corresponding number ( determined <br /> by the desired percentage ) of cg water beads in a cubic box .<br />each <br /> system was first equilibrated for a short period of time with the <br /> isotropic pressure coupling scheme and the lennard - jones ( lj ) parameters <br /> of all the atoms set to those of the beads representing water molecules <br /> in the martini force - field .<br />this setup , implemented as well in earlier <br /> cg self - assembly simulations of the lcp , allowed efficient adaptation of the volume of the simulation box <br /> to the number of cg molecules in the system , and ensured complete <br /> mixing of lipids and waters prior to self - assembly simulation .<br />after this initial equilibration phase ,<br />the lj parameters for 9.9 <br /> mag lipids were reset to their proper values ( see details of force - field <br /> parametrization , below ) , and 6 s - long self - assembly md simulations <br /> were performed ( the simulation times reported throughout are effective <br /> times , taking into consideration the <br /> factor of 4 typical for martini force - field - based coarse - grained simulations ) , <br /> and using isotropic pressure coupling ( with 3.0 ps and 3e bar time constant and compressibility , respectively ) , <br /> and a 30 fs time step .<br />to simulate rhodopsin in the diamond phase<br />, we constructed the system <br /> by replicating 27 times ( along positive and negative x , y , <br /> z directions ) one of the cubic phase structures obtained <br /> from the self - assembly simulations conducted at 20 c and at <br /> 40% ( w / w ) water .<br />the diamond cubic phase in this enlarged construct <br /> remained stable in a microsecond - long cg md simulation ( data not shown ) .<br />a rhodopsin molecule was inserted at a random position in this large <br /> cubic phase ( at 122:1 9.9mag / rhodopsin molar ratio , corresponding <br /> to 4 mg / ml concentration , see figure s1 in the supporting information ) .<br />after removing overlapping waters <br /> and 9.9 mag molecules and adding counterions for electroneutrality , <br /> a 4.8 s - long cg md simulation was carried out at 20 c .<br />the total number of cg beads in this large construct was 139  979 , <br /> which corresponds to 1  400  000 actual <br /> atoms .<br />the simulation utilized the isotropic pressure coupling <br /> scheme as above , and a 30 fs time step .<br />rhodopsin <br /> was simulated in 9.9 mag lipid lamellar bilayers with the cg martini <br /> force - field .<br />the cg model of rhodopsin ( see below ) was inserted into <br /> a pre - equilibrated cg 9.9 mag lipid membrane containing 1772 lipids , <br /> and after solvation and ionization steps , a 3.2 s - long md simulation <br /> was carried out at 20 c temperature using a 40 fs integration <br /> time step and the semi - isotropic pressure coupling scheme .<br />the details of the martini cg <br /> force fields and the parametrization scheme employed for 9.9 mag lipid <br /> and rhodopsin can be found in the supporting methods section of supporting information .<br />the residual exposure energy is the energy <br /> cost of the hydrophobic mismatch that persists in the equilibrium <br /> state of the membrane - protein interaction , even after membrane remodeling <br /> around multi - tm proteins has taken place to reduce the hydrophobic <br /> mismatch .<br />this result <br /> of the anisotropy of the protein  membrane boundary when multi - tm <br /> proteins are inserted in the bilayer has been discussed in detail . for rhodopsin , the residual exposure of residues in the tm segments <br /> was quantified with the computational protocol described in ref ( 30 ) in both the lipid cubic <br /> and lamellar phases , using solvent accessible surface area ( sasa )<br />calculations with the naccess software and a probe radius of 1.4  .<br />as described previously , sasa values <br /> were obtained either with the solute comprising the protein only ( saprot ) , or with the solute containing the protein and the hydrophobic <br /> core of the lipid bilayer ( samem)the latter being <br /> defined as the 9.9 mag bilayer region consisting of the gl1-c1a - c2a - d3a - c4a - c5a <br /> cg beads ( see above for the cg bead definition , depicted in figure 1a ) .<br />the residual exposure sares was then <br /> calculated as sares = saprot  samem for polar residues and as sares = samem for hydrophobic residues ( see ref ( 30 ) for details ) .<br />these accessible surface <br /> values were used to obtain the residual mismatch energy penalty gres associated with a particular residue as <br /> gres = ressares , where res = 0.028 kcal/(mol ) is a constant of proportionality related to the free energy <br /> of transfer of amino acids between aqueous and lipid environments .<br />according to a well - accepted protocol , interfacial trp , arg , and<br />lys residues were not penalized for residual <br /> mismatch due to their ability to adapt favorably to hydrophobic / hydrophilic <br /> interfaces .<br />for a quantitative assessment of the spatial organization of the <br /> bicontinuous lipid / water structures assembled computationally , we <br /> utilized an analytical fit of the data obtained from the simulations .<br />to obtain this fit we represented the location of the lipid bilayer <br /> midplane of the bicontinuous cubic phase by the triply periodic minimal <br /> surface ( tpms , surface with zero mean curvature):1where f(x , y , z ,  )<br />is the improved nodal approximation given by:2with3 and x = x , y =<br />y , z = z , and p , q , r =<br />c , s ( c and s stand for cosine and sine , respectively ) .<br />the { h , k , l } in the above equations are the crystallographic miller <br /> indices , and  is a fitting parameter such that 1/ represents<br />the linear size of the primitive unit cell .<br />this surface was shown <br /> to provide an accurate representation of the surface in the pn3 m symmetry group ( see , for example , ref ( 3 ) and citations therein ) .<br />for each 9.9mag / water trajectory listed in table 1 , a fit to the analytical solution was performed on 20 separate <br /> frames spaced 350 ns apart .<br />to this end<br />we extracted the coordinates <br /> { xi } of n c5a coarse - grained beads representing the location of <br /> the terminal methylene and methyl groups in the hydrocarbon tail of <br /> 9.9 mag lipids for each frame , and the fit was done by optimizing f(xi ,  ) =<br />ci through <br /> a search for the translational and rotational transformations that <br /> minimized  =<br />( 1/n)i=1ci .<br />the quality of the fit was assessed from <br /> the distribution of { ci } values obtained from the minimization procedure ; this distribution <br /> is centered around the theoretical mean , zero ( i.e. , the analytical <br /> solution of eq 1 ) .<br />such a distribution was collected <br /> for each md trajectory by merging the { ci } coefficients obtained from fitting all 20 separate <br /> frames , and the quality was assessed as described above ( see distribution <br /> plots and captions in figure 4 and in figure <br /> s3 in the supporting information ) .<br />to compare quantitatively the structural arrangement <br /> of the lcp bilayer near the protein , to that in the bulk cubic phase , <br /> we employed two complementary approaches .<br />in the first , we obtained <br /> an analytical solution for the lipid bilayer midplane around the protein <br /> by fitting the simulation data ( coordinates of c5a beads ) to f(x , y , z ,  ) =<br />ci , as described above in the tpms representation , <br /> except that for this purpose the { ci } coefficients were also considered as variable parameters <br /> that must be self - consistently minimized ( see above ) .<br />in this manner<br />, <br /> the extent of the deviation of the mean value of the { ci } distribution obtained from the solution <br /> for the pn3 m phase ( ci  0 , see above ) , <br /> measures the distortion of the diamond cubic phase due to the protein .<br />the alternative approach we developed for quantifying the perturbation <br /> of lipid bilayer shape induced by the gpcr departs from the symmetry <br /> group definition and focuses on the lipid  water boundary .<br />in <br /> this approach ,<br />different trajectory frames from the simulation of <br /> rhodopsin in lcp are aligned onto snapshots from the simulations of <br /> the large protein - depleted 9.9 mag / water system .<br />using a locally defined <br /> scoring function ( see below ) , we assess how well the lipid bilayers <br /> of the protein - containing and protein - free systems align ( the large <br /> protein - free system was constructed by replicating 27 times the equilibrated <br /> system composed of 500 9.9 mag lipids/6800 water molecules , and subjecting <br /> it to microsecond long cg md simulation during which the pn3 m phase was maintained ; data not shown ) .<br />to align the protein - free <br /> and protein - containing structures , we <br /> used water densities to first align 10 frames from the last 100 ns <br /> of the protein - free simulation , which served as a reference on which <br /> we aligned 10 frames from the last 100 ns of the protein - containing <br /> trajectory .<br />only water beads at least 50  away from the protein <br /> were considered , in order to avoid degradation of the alignment quality <br /> due to deformations of the lipid cubic phase near the protein .<br />the alignments utilized the electron density (y ) at any point y of a set of beads with coordinates <br /> ri ; the density function was constructed <br /> as a superposition of gaussians , so that for a particular trajectory <br /> frame4where c and k are the amplitude and width of the gaussians , respectively , chosen <br /> to produce a 10  resolution density map .<br />the quality of the superposition of two frames was <br /> estimated by <br /> measuring the overlap of the water - containing and water - free regions <br /> using:5where x = { xj } ( j = 1,2, ... ,m1 , m1 + 1, ... ,n ) are coordinates of beads in <br /> the fitted frame which contains m1 water <br /> beads and n  m1 lipid beads ; w is the density <br /> of water in the reference frame obtained using eq 5 ; sj = 1 for j  m1 , and sj = 1 for j > m1 .<br />the best alignment was calculated by maximizing s with respect to the rotational and translational transformations <br /> applied to x. the local quality of the alignment <br /> was assessed by a normalized <br /> scoring function defined as:6where (xj ) represents the electron density of the <br /> beads in the reference frame .<br />the self - assembly of the 9.9 mag / water complex <br /> with 40% ( w / w ) water composition was probed at 20 c , which are <br /> conditions similar to those used in the original in meso crystallization trials of gpcr proteins ( see ref ( 14 ) and citations therein ) .<br />figures 2 and 3 show several views of <br /> 9.9 mag / water complexes obtained under these conditions produced by <br /> the 6 s - long self - assembly simulation of 500 9.9 mag lipids .<br />in figure 2 , panels a  c offer views <br /> of the unit simulation cell , whereas figure 3 depicts various snapshots of the same system replicated 27 times <br /> ( 3 times in each orthogonal direction ) .<br />typically , in our simulations <br /> the initially randomly mixed 9.9 mag / water system became organized <br /> as illustrated in figures 23 within the first 350 ns of simulation , and remained <br /> stable for the remainder of the 6 s trajectory .<br />( a , b ) views of the unit <br /> simulation cell containing 9.9 mag / water <br /> complex at 40% ( w / w ) water concentration and at 20 c temperature , <br /> after 6 s of self - assembly simulation .<br />( a ) entire system where <br /> different components are colored as following : 9.9 mag lipid headgroup <br /> beads , blue ; 9.9 mag lipid hydrocarbon tail beads , red ; and water <br /> beads , cyan .<br />( b ) separately 9.9 mag hydrocarbon chain beads from the <br /> same perspective as in a. ( c ) view of the tetrahedral arrangement <br /> of the water channel from a. the four arms of the tetrahedral geometry <br /> are visible .<br />( d ) snapshot of two nonintersecting continuous intertwined <br /> water channels ( in gold and cyan , respectively ) .<br />the representations <br /> are for the  expanded  system obtained by replicating <br /> the simulated system 9 times ( in positive x , y , and z directions ) .<br />views of the 9.9 mag / water complex from figure 2 replicated 27 times ( 3 times in positive and negative x , y , and z directions ) reveal bicontinuous <br /> diamond cubic phase nature of the self - assembled structure .<br />different <br /> panels show : the entire system ( a ) , 9.9 mag headgroup and water cg<br />beads ( b ) , 9.9 mag hydrocarbon chain beads ( c ) , only water beads ( d ) .<br />the bicontinuous cubic phase nature of the self - assembled <br /> structure <br /> is apparent from inspection of the spatial organization of both lipid <br /> and water components .<br />indeed , the hydrophobic core of the 9.9 mag <br /> lipids ( shown in red in figures 23 ) traces a single highly curved continuous surface <br /> in 3d , surrounded by 9.9 mag headgroups ( dark blue shades in figures 23 ) adjacent to aqueous <br /> compartments ( cyan colors in figures 2a , c and 3 ) .<br />the aqueous part of the system consists of two <br /> nonintersecting three - dimensional continuous networks of water channels <br /> ( figure 2d ) , which makes the assembled structure <br /> a bicontinuous cubic phase .<br />figure 2c <br /> shows that in each of the water <br /> compartments four aqueous channels meet in a tetrahedral arrangement .<br />a similar arrangement can be observed as well for the surface traced <br /> by the hydrocarbon chains of 9.9 mag lipids ( see figures 2b and 3c ) .<br />thus , the assembled structure <br /> resembles closely the doubly bicontinuous lipidic diamond cubic phase .<br />one general feature of such mesophases is that the surface traced <br /> by the midplane of the lipid bilayer , which separates the two aqueous <br /> compartments , can be approximated by the triply periodic minimal surface <br /> ( tpms ) that has a special property : it is characterized at every point <br /> by zero mean curvature .<br />consequently , the tpms is saddle - shaped ( figure <br /> s2 , supporting information ) .<br />this saddle - shaped <br /> geometry of the 9.9 mag / water assembly resulting from our calculations <br /> can be appreciated , for example , by tracing the surface formed by <br /> the 9.9 mag hydrophobic core ( see figures 23 ) .<br />for a quantitative assessment <br /> of the adherence of the bicontinuous <br /> structure from our simulations to the organization of the pn3 m diamond cubic phase<br />, we performed a fit of the simulation <br /> data to the analytical solution , as described in methods .<br />the quality of the fit was assessed quantitatively <br /> from the distribution of the fitting coefficients { ci } ( see methods ) shown in figure 4 .<br />clearly , the distribution is centered around zero mean , and is <br /> relatively narrow ( with a standard deviation of 0.4 ) , suggesting <br /> that the surface traced by the c5a beads is consistent with the tpms <br /> of the pn3 m cubic phase ( see eqs 13 ) .<br />distribution of { ci } coefficients from the fitting <br /> of the c5a bead positions from the <br /> simulations to the analytical tpms approximation ( see methods ) .<br />the  test established the significance of the fit <br /> with probability p < 0.05 .<br />as indicated in table 1 , <br /> the self - assembly <br /> of 9.9 mag / water mixture was investigated in two additional simulations <br /> performed at t =<br />20 c and 40% ( w / w ) water content .<br />in all cases 9.9<br />mag and water molecules aggregated in doubly bicontinuous <br /> diamond lipid cubic phases , similar to that described in figures 23 ( see figure s3 <br /> in the supporting information ) .<br />to explore the organization <br /> of a gpcr inside the cubic mesophase we simulated the prototypical <br /> class - a gpcr , rhodopsin , in 9.9 mag - containing lipidic cubic phase <br /> in a large system constructed as described in methods .<br />the simulation results were used as described below to compare <br /> quantitatively the interactions of rhodopsin with bilayers of the <br /> cubic and lamellar phases , as a basis for interpreting the mechanistic <br /> role of the hydrophobic mismatch in triggering the nucleation process <br /> during the in - meso crystallization .<br />residues in the rhodopsin tm bundle that participate <br /> in unfavorable interfacial hydrophobic / hydrophilic interactions with <br /> the lipid bilayers of the cubic and lamellar phase were identified , <br /> as described in methods , with a sasa - based <br /> approach .<br />the last 1.5 s intervals <br /> from the respective cg md trajectories for rhodopsin in the 9.9 mag <br /> lcp ( 4.8 s ) , and in the 9.9 mag lipid lamellar phase ( for 3.2 <br /> s ) were used for the residual exposure analysis ( see methods for definitions ) , and the corresponding <br /> residual exposure energies were evaluated as described .<br />table 2 lists rhodopsin<br />tm residues that were found to exhibit different hydrophobic exposures <br /> in the lcp and lamellar phase simulations , alongside their respective <br /> residual exposure energy penalties ( gres ) .<br />all other residues in the tm bundle experienced a residual <br /> penalty of < 1 kbt ( kb denoting the boltzmann constant ) in both lpc <br /> and lamellar phases .<br />analysis was carried out on the <br /> last 1.5 s time interval of the respective trajectories where <br /> sasa values and corresponding residual exposure energies remained , <br /> within fluctuations , unchanged .<br />numbering shown in parentheses corresponds <br /> to the generic residue numbering scheme for gpcrs defined by ballesteros <br /> and weinstein .<br />different residual exposure in the two lipid environments <br /> became <br /> evident for residues in the extracellular ( ec ) end of tmh1 , and the <br /> intracellular side ( ic ) of tmh5 ( table 2 ) .<br />specifically , the pro34/gln36 pair on <br /> tmh1 ( superscript numbers identify the residues by the ballesteros <br /> and weinstein generic residue numbering scheme for gpcrs ) , and phe228 in tmh5 were found <br /> to generate a lower residual exposure energy penalty in the lcp than <br /> in the lamellar phase .<br />especially remarkable is the difference in <br /> gres for the hydrophobic pro34 residue , that is , 4.7 kbt in the lamellar bilayers , but < 1 kbt in the cubic phase .<br />this difference <br /> results from pro34 being largely exposed to the lipid <br /> polar headgroups and/or water environment in the planar membrane , <br /> but shielded from such unfavorable interactions in the lcp .<br />the large residual exposure predicted for pro34 in <br /> the lamellar 9.9 mag bilayers is consistent with findings from our <br /> earlier all - atom md simulations of rhodopsin in planar membranes composed <br /> of dicn:1pc ( n = 14 , 16 , 18 , 20 ) lipids ; <br /> the largest residual exposure for pro34 was found in <br /> the bilayers with the thinnest hydrophobic core , that is , dic14:1pc and dic16:1pc membranes .<br />due to the substantial <br /> difference between the hydrophobic length of tmh1 in rhodopsin ( 37  , measured along <br /> the membrane normal )<br />and the bulk hydrophobic thickness of the thinner bilayers ( 27.2 <br /> and 30.5  , respectively for dic14:1pc and dic16:1pc membranes ) , the mismatch was <br /> not alleviated by membrane deformations around the protein ( see ref ( 30 ) ) .<br />here<br />, the hydrophobic <br /> thickness of the 9.9 mag lamellar bilayers , calculated from the average <br /> distance between the lipid gl1 backbone beads on the two leaflets , <br /> is 31.5  , so that the hydrophobic mismatch between tmh1 and <br /> the bilayer is again substantial , and can be alleviated only partially <br /> by membrane deformation , as shown below .<br />the average thickness <br /> of the 9.9 mag lamellar bilayer around rhodopsin , <br /> calculated from the last 1.5 s of the md trajectory and the <br /> membrane thinning around tmh2the helix adjacent to tmh1is <br /> evident in figure 5 .<br />interestingly , we find <br /> that the bilayer deforms near the polar ser98 residue <br /> ( see figure 5d ) , which is apparently shielded <br /> from the unfavorable exposure to the hydrophobic lipid core by the <br /> local thinning of the lipid membrane .<br />usually , the membrane - facing<br />oh of ser residues in a tm bundle can avoid hydrophobic contact <br /> by forming hydrogen bonds with the helix backbone .<br />when this is not <br /> feasible energetically , the bilayer thins around this residue .<br />in <br /> our simulations<br />we find that in order to shield ser98 from unfavorable hydrophobic exposure , the thinning at tmh2 also <br /> constrains the lipids at the adjacent tmh1 ( see ref ( 30 ) for a discussion of this <br /> type of constraint ) , so that the membrane can not deform significantly <br /> and thus leaves the pro34 residue highly exposed ( see <br /> figure 5d and table 2 ) .<br />( a  c ) views of membrane deformation patterns around the <br /> rhodopsin immersed into 9.9 mag lamellar bilayers .<br />the average positioning <br /> of membrane leaflets is identified by the two surfaces colored according <br /> to the local thickness of the bilayer ( see the bar for color definition ) .<br />the gpcr is shown in van der waals representation with the tm helices <br /> colored as follows : tm1 in gray , tm2 in orange , tm3 in white , tm4 <br /> in pink , tm5 in purple , tm6 in black , and tm7 in lime the rest of <br /> the protein ( loops , etc . )<br />( d ) magnified view of the <br /> region containing residues pro34 and ser98 ( both rendered in green ) showing the membrane deformations in their <br /> vicinity .<br />figure 5 shows that the <br /> 9.9 mag planar bilayer <br /> deforms around other tm helices as well .<br />specifically , the membrane <br /> thins around tmh4 , alleviating the residual mismatch for this helix , <br /> and around tmh7 where the deformation efficiently accommodates the <br /> juxtaposed amphipathic helix 8 at the hydrophobic / hydrophilic interface .<br />overall , the heterogeneous pattern of membrane deformations we observe <br /> around rhodopsin in the current simulations agrees with earlier findings <br /> from all - atom md simulations showing the pattern of membrane remodeling <br /> around rhodopsin and the homologous serotonin 5-ht2a gpcr .<br />consistent with those studies , <br /> we find here that the deformations of the lamellar 9.9 mag bilayer <br /> do not completely alleviate the hydrophobic mismatch with the receptor <br /> ( table 2 ) .<br />the different organization of the <br /> two lipid phases around the gpcr , as presented below , explains why <br /> the residual exposure was larger for rhodopsin in the lamellar 9.9 <br /> mag bilayer than in the 9.9 mag lcp .<br />figure 6 shows the <br /> organization of the lipid cubic phase around rhodopsin in the initial <br /> configuration where the protein was randomly inserted in the lcp ( see <br /> also figure s1 in the supporting information ) , compared to the organization after 4.8 s of cg md simulations .<br />c with d  f in figure 6 shows the substantial rearrangement of the lipids and solvent <br /> around rhodopsin during the long md trajectory .<br />specifically , it appears <br /> that the lcp tends to minimize hydrophobic / hydrophilic contacts with <br /> the gpcr as the water and lipid headgroup beads organize around polar <br /> regions of the protein ( yellow colors in figure 6 ) , whereas the lipid hydrocarbon chain beads surround the hydrophobic <br /> core of the protein ( see caption of figure 6 for tm definitions ) .<br />snapshots illustrating initial ( a  c ) , and final <br /> ( after 4.8 <br /> s simulations ) positioning ( d  f ) of rhodopsin ( in yellow / white )<br />inside the cubic phase .<br />a and d show the organization of water beads<br />( in cyan ) , b and e illustrate the organization of 9.9 mag lipid headgroup<br />beads ( in pink ) , and c and f show the organization of 9.9 mag lipid <br /> hydrophobic core beads ( in purple ) .<br />in all panels<br />rhodopsin transmembrane <br /> ( tm ) helices are colored in white and the rest of the protein in yellow .<br />shown are only water and 9.9 mag lipids that are within 20  <br /> of rhodopsin ; rhodopsin is oriented so that its intracellular and <br /> extracellular ends ( as defined in the lipid bilayer ) point toward <br /> the bottom and top of the panels , respectively .<br />the snapshots in figure 6 also show that <br /> rhodopsin equilibrates , as expected , around the saddle - point inside <br /> the lcp so that the tm bundle perpendicularly <br /> traverses a narrow but relatively flattened region of the lcp bilayer , <br /> much like the gpcr protein does in the lamellar bilayers .<br />however , <br /> due to continuous and intrinsically saddle - shaped geometry of the <br /> diamond cubic phase , the lcp bilayer is dramatically curved near tmh1 <br /> and tmh5 , which effectively confines the protein to a small region <br /> of the lcp .<br />this special arrangement of the cubic mesophase around <br /> rhodopsin shields the gpcr in the lcp from the kind of unfavorable <br /> hydrophobic / hydrophilic interactions with the lipid bilayer seen in <br /> the lamellar membranes .<br />thus , as illustrated in figure s4 ( in the supporting information ) and reflected in the <br /> residual energy penalties ( in table 2 ) , residues <br /> pro34 and phe228 are in contact with <br /> the hydrophobic core of the lcp bilayer and therefore do not incur <br /> a residual mismatch penalty , although gln36 experiences <br /> somewhat higher residual exposure in the lcp compared to the lamellar <br /> phase ( see figure s4 and table 2 ) .<br />glamellar to be 2.7 kbt for the pro34/gln36 pair , and 1.8 kbt for phe228 ( table 2 ) .<br />notably , the shielding of ser98 that faced the 9.9 mag lipid bilayer in the lamellar phase <br /> simulations , occurs in the lcp simulations through interaction with <br /> the protein backbone .<br />to relate the calculated residual mismatch <br /> energies to the organization <br /> of the lipidic cubic mesophase around the gpcr , we quantitatively <br /><br />compared the structural arrangement of the lcp bilayer near the protein , <br /> to that in the bulk cubic phase .<br />as described in methods ,<br />two different approaches were used : in the first , <br /> we obtained an analytical fit of the lipid bilayer midplane shape <br /> around the protein by fitting the coordinates of 9.9 mag lipid c5a <br /> methyl terminus beads ( figure 1a ) from the <br /> simulations to f(x , y , z ,  ) =<br />ci , considering <br /> { ci } coefficients as <br /> variable parameters that must be minimized during the fitting ( see methods ) .<br />the application of this procedure to spherical <br /> lipid shells situated at different distances from rhodopsin ( see figure 7a ) revealed that the organization of the lcp close <br /> to the gpcr is different from that expected for the pn3 m lipid bilayer ( ci  0 in figure 7a ) .<br />however , <br /> already at distances 50  from the center of rhodopsin <br /> ( compare to 3540  linear dimension of a rhodopsin - like <br /> gpcr in bilayer x  y plane directions ) , the <br /> simulated structure relaxes to the organization of the diamond cubic <br /> phase ( ci <br /> = 0 , figure 7a ) .<br />the second approach confirms <br /> that the distorted lcp bilayer near the protein tends to relax toward <br /> the pn3 m phase arrangement at larger distances ( figure 7b ) .<br />in this alternative approach<br />we locally quantify <br /> the shape of the lipid bilayer around the gpcr by aligning trajectory <br /> frames from the simulation of rhodopsin in lcp onto snapshots from <br /> the simulations of the pure lcp system , so as to optimize the overlap <br /> of the water - containing and water - free regions ( see methods ) .<br />a scoring function defined locally ( see eq 5 ) is used to assess the quality of the alignment .<br />as seen from figure 7b , this procedure revealed <br /> that the fit between the densities of c5a lipid beads in protein - containing <br /> and protein - free systems progressively improves with the radial distance <br /> from the gpcr ( increasing s in figure 7b ) .<br />indeed , consistent with the result in figure 7a , the scoring function reaches its plateau 50  <br /> away from the protein , indicating that at these distances the lcp <br /> arrangement becomes similar to that expected for the pn3 m phase .<br />distance dependence of the relaxation of membrane deformation near <br /> rhodopsin in the cubic phase .<br />( a ) analytical fit of the density of <br /> c5a 9.9 mag lipid beads from cg md simulation of rhodopsin in the <br /> lcp phase to the surface defined by the f(x , y , z ,  ) =<br />ci equation ( see methods ) .<br />the mean values <br /> of the { ci } fitting coefficient <br /> distribution as a function of r , are shown for 10 <br />  spherical lipid shells located at r = 20 , 30 , 40 , and 50  away the protein center - of - mass .<br />( b ) reasults from the same measurements performed with an alternative <br /> approach based on the alignment of the lipid bilayer midplane in protein - containing <br /> and protein - free cubic phases ( see methods ) .<br />the quality of the fit upon alignment was determined for 10  <br /> spherical lipid shells located at distances r from <br /> the protein center - of - mass , and the panel shows the dependence of <br /> the scoring function s on r. note <br /> that the deformed cubic phase near rhodopsin relaxes to the arrangement <br /> that is characteristic of the pn3 m phase 50 <br />  away from the protein .<br />taken together , our results establish a quantitative <br /> link between <br /> the residual mismatch penalty and the lipid bilayer deformations around <br /> the gpcr in the cubic phase .<br />thus , the areas where the largest perturbations <br /> from the diamond cubic phase were observed included residues pro34 and phe228 ( see figure s5 in the supporting material ) , which are also the residues <br /> with the largest value of glcp  <br /> glamellar ( table 2 ) .<br />the main findings from this study offer <br /> unprecedented insight into <br /> molecular level processes related to in meso crystallization , <br /> which are likely leading to protein nucleation and eventually to crystal <br /> growth .<br />thus , we found that the difference in the hydrophobic / hydrophilic <br /> exposure of the protein to the lipid bilayers of 9.9 mag lcp and lamellar <br /> phases is responsible for a lower residual mismatch ( and its corresponding <br /> energy penalty ) in the cubic mesophase compared to the lamellar membranes .<br />this indicates why gpcrs reconstituted into the lcp in the initial <br /> stages of the in meso trial are well accommodated <br /> inside the cubic phase , where they are believed to reside mostly in <br /> the monomeric form .<br />indeed , from our findings there is insignificant <br /> drive toward rhodopsin oligomerization in the lcp .<br />we showed , however , <br /> why this drive is increased in the planar bilayer environment of the <br /> lamellar phase where there are several critical mechanistic factors <br /> that determine the probability for proteins to oligomerize .<br />one important <br /> energy component that has been established from both experiments and computations , involves the hydrophobic mismatch .<br />in particular , a plausible mechanism to relieve the energy penalty <br /> due to residual exposure is protein oligomerization , whereby the tm <br /> segments incurring the highest energy penalty from the residual exposure <br /> come together in the lipid bilayer .<br />for <br /> such hydrophobic - mismatch driven association to occur<br />, the <br /> residual exposure penalty alleviated by the protein association must <br /> counteract other critical factors that could favor proteins in the <br /> monomeric state .<br />one such important consideration is the mobility <br /> of proteins , because constrained diffusion reduces the chance for <br /> protein  protein encounter .<br />as shown in figure 8 , the spatial restriction encountered by the gpcr inside the <br /> lcp<br />( see figure 6 ) significantly affects protein <br /> mobility , with the diffusion coefficient of the gpcr in the cubic <br /> phase being smaller ( dlcp = 1.1  <br /> 10 m / sec ) than that in the lamellar <br /> bilayers ( dlamellar = 5.5  10 m / sec ) .<br />the restricted diffusion mode <br /> for rhodopsin in the lcp environment is consistent with the suggested <br /> high energy cost in the lcp for gpcr - sized proteins to cross between <br /> different regions of the mesophase .<br />this <br /> energy penalty was quantified from phenomenological principles to <br /> be as high as 1220 kbt in the pn3 m phase with lattice parameter values in the 75110  <br /> range .<br />this estimated energy cost of protein <br /> diffusion in the lcp is significantly higher than the residual mismatch <br /> penalty we calculated for rhodopsin in the cubic phase ( table 2 ) .<br />when considered together , the relatively low <br /> residual exposure energy for the gpcr in the lcp is not likely to <br /> be sufficient to compensate for the high energy barrier for protein <br /> mobility in the lcp and drive protein association .<br />the prediction <br /> is , therefore , that in the cubic mesophase gpcr proteins will remain <br /> largely in the monomeric state .<br />mean - square - displacement ( msd ) as a function of <br /> time calculated for rhodopsin in the 9.9 mag lipidic cubic phase ( lcp ) <br /> and in the 9.9 mag lamellar membrane ( lamellar ) .<br />corresponding diffusion <br /> coefficient values , calculated from the linear fit performed in [ 0 <br /> s;1 s ] time interval , are dlcp =<br />1.1  10 m / sec and dlamellar =<br />5.5  10 m / sec .<br />in contrast to the lcp , the lamellar membrane environment <br /> is more <br /> favorable for gpcr oligomerization : the residual energy penalty for <br /> the rhodopsin tm bundle in the lamellar bilayers is 8 kbt ( table 2 ) and is significantly higher compared to that in the lcp , <br /> indicating a stronger drive for gpcr oligomerization in the lamellar <br /> membranes .<br />a higher propensity for association in the planar bilayers <br /> is also supported by our calculations of the protein mobility in the <br /> two lipid environments , whereby we find a 5-fold larger diffusion <br /> coefficient for the gpcr in the lamellar bilayers ( figure 8) .<br />taken together , results from our simulations <br /> suggest that planar <br /> 9.9 mag lipid membranes provide a more suitable setting for oligomerization <br /> of the gpcr proteins .<br />notably , this prediction is based on results <br /> for oligomerization in a plane of the lipid bilayer .<br />this 2d nucleation <br /> process together with the formation of protein - enriched lamellar stacks <br /> in 3d should ultimately drive the emergence <br /> of a bulk crystal .<br />the question remains regarding the mechanism <br /> that drives the proteins <br /> from the lcp to the lamellar membranes and the potential role of the <br /> differential residual interactions between the protein and the bilayers <br /> of the two lipidic phases in the nucleation process .<br />we note that <br /> the nucleation is triggered by the addition of the precipitant which <br /> is known to cause transient water depletion from the lcp interior , resulting in structural changes in the cubic <br /> phase bilayer .<br />our current study has not attempted to quantify the <br /> effects of the precipitant , but it is reasonable to speculate that <br /> dehydration of the cubic phase will only increase the unfavorable <br /> residual interactions between the gpcr and the lcp bilayer .<br />this is likely to increase the drive for protein <br /> oligomerization inside the lcp upon precipitant addition , which could <br /> lead to the formation of locally flattened lamellar bilayers as a <br /> prelude to protein crystallization .<br />in order to address quantitatively <br /> the structural perturbations due to precipitant , such as changes in <br /> curvature of the lcp bilayer ,<br />it is critical to calculate the corresponding <br /> deformation energies in the presence of the protein .<br />however , the <br /> representation of the complex geometry of the lcp around the insertion <br /> ( figures 67 )<br />in the numerical approach developed in the current work for quantifying <br /> the lcp shape ( i.e. , fitting the md data to the analytical solution )<br />is not sufficiently refined to serve in the calculation of reliable <br /> energies<br />we note , however , that recent experimental studies showed that , compared to 9.9 <br /> mag , in meso trials conducted on the gpcr - gs protein <br /> complex with a shorter chain mag analog , 7.7 mag ( acyl chain 14 carbon <br /> atoms long with the cis double bond between carbon atoms 7 and 8) <br /> resulted in better quality crystals .<br />thus , results from our <br /> current studies as well as from recently reported all - atom simulations <br /> of gpcrs in membranes of different thicknesses , explain why 7.7 mag would provide a better platform in <br /> which gpcrs can aggregate more extensively : based on our findings <br /> we can predict that , due to the expected 78  <br /> difference in the hydrophobic thickness of planar 9.9 mag and 7.7 <br /> mag membranes , the residual exposure of the gpcr will be substantially <br /> higher in the thinner 7.7 mag lamellar bilayers . as an example<br />, we <br /> recently reported that the rhodopsin tm bundle will exhibit a 12 kbt higher residual energy penalty <br /> in dic14:1pc than in dic18:1pc bilayers .<br />a more complete quantitative elucidation of <br /> the gpcr nucleation process in relation to the residual mismatch energy <br /> component requires further studies that would take into consideration <br /> the effect of the different precipitants on various lipids .<br />the structurally specific predictions of the regions where the <br /> residual mismatch with lipid bilayers of cubic and lamellar phases <br /> differed for the rhodopsin tm bundle made it possible to probe the <br /> resulting predictions and general character of the findings by examining <br /> crystallographic data .<br />in particular , we showed here that the intracellular <br /> ( ic ) end of tmh1 ( pro34 ) , and<br />the extracellular ( ec ) <br /> part of the tmh5 including phe228 have higher residual <br /> exposure in lamellar membranes , which leads to the prediction ( e.g. , <br /> see shan et al . )<br />that in the planar bilayers <br /> rhodopsin will exhibit strong hydrophobic - mismatch driven tendency <br /> for oligomerization through tmh1 and tmh5 . to assess this hypothesis <br /> in the context of structural information available for gpcrs , we examined <br /> crystallographic contact interfaces for 12 different structures of <br /> rhodopsin - like gpcrs obtained by means of the in meso technology ( 2 receptor  pbd codes : 2rh1 , 3pds , 3sn6 ; a2a receptor  <br /> pdb codes : 3eml , 3qak ; chemokine <br /> cxcr4 receptor  pdb codes : 3odu , 3oe0 , 3oe6 , 3oe8 , 3oe9 ; dopamine d3 receptor <br />  pdb code : 3pbl , and histamine h1 receptor  pdb code : 3rze ) .<br />for all these <br /> gpcr structures , we analyzed the content of the unit crystallographic <br /> cell and quantified for each tm helix ( 1 ) the frequency of its occurrence <br /> at the crystallographic contact interface and ( 2 ) the number of residue <br /> interactions each tm helix forms at the contact interface .<br />canonical  interfaces were considered , <br /> where the crystallographic contacts were formed exclusively through <br /> tm  tm interactions between monomers in parallel orientations .<br />remarkably , we found that tmh1 and tmh5 , the two helices implicated <br /> in the largest residual mismatch in our simulations of rhodopsin with <br /> 9.9 mag lamellar bilayers , contribute to the most common contact interfaces <br /> in the crystallographic structures of the homologous gpcrs .<br />more specifically , <br /> as illustrated in figure s6a ( see supporting information ) , all but 4 of the 14 distinct intermolecular tm <br />tm interfaces <br /> identified in this analysis , involve tmh1 and/or tmh5 . furthermore , <br /> examining the residues involved in the interactions at the contact <br /> interfaces revealed that the tmh1 stretch of residues in positions <br /> 1.291.34 ( that would include pro34 in the homologous <br /> rhodopsin gpcr ) contribute significantly to the formation of the crystallographic <br /> interface .<br />during the final preparation of this manuscript , <br /> two new crystal <br /> structures of rhodopsin - like gpcrs ,<br />the -opioid receptor ( kor ) <br /> and the -opioid receptor ( mor ) were reported to be obtained <br /> by means of in meso crystallization .<br />consistent with the data presented above , the crystallographic interface <br /> of kor consists of tm1 , tm2 and h8 , with the n - terminal end of tm1 <br /> ( region harboring the residue homologous to pro34 in <br /> rhodopsin ) forming extensive dimeric contacts .<br />for mor , two crystallographic <br /> interfaces were reported : the more prominent interface consisted of<br />tm5/tm6 helices with the i256 residue ( aligning with <br /> the residue next to phe228 in rhodopsin ) residing at <br /> the dimer interface , and more limited contacts formed by tm1 , tm2 <br /> and h8 . taken together ,<br />our findings support the mechanistic <br /> inferences <br /> that ( 1 ) the reduced level of hydrophobic mismatch in the lcp is attributable <br /> to the specific highly curved geometry of the cubic phase that provides <br /> for more coverage from unfavorable hydrophobic exposure ; ( 2 ) compared <br /> to the lcp , lamellar structures provide a more favorable setting in <br /> which gpcrs can oligomerize as a prelude to nucleation and crystal <br /> growth ; and ( 3 ) the extent of the residual mismatch penalty is likely <br /> one of the critical mechanistic factors that determines not only the <br /> drive for gpcr proteins to oligomerize during in meso crystallization , but also the structural elements that are likely <br /> to participate in contact interfaces .<br />these findings provide <br /> novel energy - based insights into in meso crystallization <br /> mechanisms and lay a foundation <br /> for future computational explorations involving other class - a gpcrs <br /> toward designing rational approaches for generation of structure - quality <br /> crystals of membrane proteins .", "summary": "high quality crystals of g - protein coupled receptor ( gpcr ) proteins can be grown by growing them in lipidic cubic phases ( lcps ) formed by a continuous bicontinuous mesophase of the lipid and the aqueous channels. the lipidic cubic phase is a prototypical bicontinuous mesophase that tracings a triply periodic pn3 m minimal surface. because of its continuous nature, lcps of gpcrs have been grown in monoolein, phosphatidylcholine, and tetrahydrofuran, and also monoolein / cholesterol. we demonstrate that crystallization of several gpcr -

grained beads <br /> from the 9.9 mag lipid ( see a ) ; note the cubic phase structure .<br />the <br /> similarity evident in b and c underscores the close relation between <br /> the organization of the c5a beads ( representing the density of terminal <br /> methylene and methyl groups in 9.9 mag lipids ) and the tpms of the pn3 m cubic phase .<br />the rapid pace of new structural data acquisition using the features of the in meso method <br /> underscores the usefulness and success of the technology .<br />thus , structural <br /> information obtained in this manner for several rhodopsin - like gpcrs <br /> ( reviewed in ref ( 6 ) ) and a gpcr - g protein complex , provided <br /> breakthrough insights about the structural basis for signal transduction <br /> through these 7-tm helical proteins .<br />however , the present lack of <br /> a mechanistic understanding , at the molecular level , of the events <br /> that lead to in meso crystallization of membrane <br /> proteins , makes the success of the method somewhat enigmatic and results <br /> in the need for extensive trials to identify specific conditions , <br /> that is , the host and additive lipid , precipitant etc .<br />such in meso trials begin with the target<br />protein <br /> being reconstituted into the lcp , and a hypothetical descriptive mechanism <br /> based on the membrane curvature and hydrophobic mismatch has been <br /> proposed to address <br /> the crucial step during in meso crystallization  the <br /> preferential partitioning of proteins from the lcp to the lamellar <br /> phase .<br />in the original trials ,<br />the lipid used to form the lcp was <br /> monoolein ( 9.9 mag , see figure 1a ) , however <br /> recent experiments have utilized shorter chain analogs of monoolein <br /> as well as mixtures of monoolein with cholesterol ( see refs ( 12 , 18,21)and citations <br /> therein ) .<br />the reconstituted proteins appear to be well - accommodated , <br /> functional , and mobile inside the lcp where they are believed to reside <br /> largely in a monomeric state .<br />the addition of a precipitant <br /> of suitable composition , which is <br /> the next step in the in meso trial , is proposed to <br /> result in local structural and compositional changes in the mesophase <br /> and likely in protein conformation as well , which alter the interactions between the <br /> proteins and the cubic phase lipid bilayer ; ultimately this drives <br /> the preferential partitioning of the proteins into the lamellar phase <br /> that presumably appears within the lcp .<br />the critical aspect of the nucleation and subsequent crystal growth <br /> process that is triggered in this manner , and ultimately determines <br /> the quality of the grown crystals , is that once they have diffused <br /> from the lcp to the lamellar phase the proteins form tight 3d oligomeric <br /> arrays .<br />the oligomerization of <br /> tm proteins in lipid bilayers has generally <br /> been suggested to involve the hydrophobic mismatch effects originating <br /> from the difference in the lengths of the hydrophobic core of the <br /> protein and the surrounding lipid hydrocarbon region .<br />such mismatch effects have been shown from experiments to play a <br /> role not only in the spatial organization but also in the function <br /> of tm proteins , such as the gpcr rhodopsin .<br />the hydrophobic mismatch is considered to drive the membrane to <br /> deform in order to alleviate the energetically unfavorable hydrophilic / hydrophobic <br /> exposure this mismatch entails .<br />when such membrane deformation can not <br /> achieve a complete hydrophobic adaptation , the  residual exposure  <br /> ( or  residual mismatch  ) to unfavorable interactions <br /> gives rise to an unfavorable contribution to the free energy of protein / membrane <br /> interaction .<br />the mitigation of this energy <br /> term through oligomerization has been suggested as an important mechanistic <br /> contribution to membrane - driven oligomerization of multihelical tm <br /> proteins , such as gpcrs , in lipid bilayers .<br />therefore , we investigated the potential role of differential hydrophobic <br /> exposure of such proteins in lipid bilayers of the cubic and lamellar <br /> phases as a possible determinant of the favorable outcome of in meso crystallization trials .<br />here<br />we present the <br /> results of a molecular dynamics - based study <br /> of a gpcr reconstituted into an lcp environment that reveal differences <br /> in the hydrophobic / hydrophilic exposure of the gpcr to lipid <br />the quantitative results <br /> reflect the drive for differential oligomerization behavior of these <br /> proteins in the two lipid environments that essentially define the <br /> end points along the in meso crystallization pathway .<br />with the ability to connect quantitatively the difference in gpcr <br /> oligomerization behavior in the two different media , to the curvature <br /> and mismatch alleviation capabilities of the two environments ,<br />we <br /> are able to predict lipid types that would enhance / diminish the difference <br /> in the residual exposure for a gpcr in the cubic and lamellar phases .<br />given the recognized importance of protein <br />membrane interaction <br /> for the functional properties of gpcrs , molecular dynamics simulation <br /> studies using all - atom and coarse - grained representations have been carried out for the prototypical gpcr , <br /> rhodopsin , in lamellar membranes .<br />to our knowledge<br />the present work <br /> is the first molecular dynamics - based study of a gpcr reconstituted <br /> into the lcp .<br />the results enable quantitative inferences about the <br /> energetically unfavorable hydrophobic  hydrophilic interactions <br /> that differentiate the behaviors of gpcrs in the two different lipid <br /> environments , lcp and lamellar membranes .<br />we attain these insights <br /> from comparative microsecond time - scale coarse - grained simulations <br /> with the martini force - field of rhodopsin in monoolein - based <br /> cubic and lamellar lipid bilayers .<br />using our recently reported computational <br /> framework for quantifying residual mismatch energies from md trajectories<br />, we evaluated the protein - dependent membrane <br /> deformations and their attendant energy cost , and identified specific <br /> tm regions and residues of rhodopsin that exhibit differential hydrophobic <br /> exposure in the lcp and lamellar bilayers .<br />we show that the bilayer <br /> of the lcp more efficiently shields the protein from unfavorable interactions , <br /> and that the reduced level of hydrophobic mismatch in the lcp is attributable <br /> to the specific , highly curved geometry of the cubic phase .<br />better <br /> protection from unfavorable hydrophobic exposure of rhodopsin in the <br /> lcp phase is especially evident for residues in tm helix 1 ( tmh1 ) <br /> and tmh5 .<br />lcp environment , the planar bilayer of the lamellar phase provides <br /> a more favorable setting for gpcr oligomerization as a prelude to <br /> nucleation and crystal growth .<br />thus , our findings provide novel energy - based <br /> insights into driving elements of in meso crystallization <br /> mechanisms and lay the foundation for future quantitative exploration <br /> of rational approaches for the generation of structure - quality crystals <br /> of membrane proteins .<br />coarse - grained ( cg ) md simulations of the lipid <br /> cubic phases ( lcp ) with or without rhodopsin were done with the martini <br /> force field , grouping atoms into coarse - grained <br /> beads ( see figure 1a ) , and the gromacs 3.3.1 <br /> package as listed for the various molecular <br /> constructs in table 1 . as a host lipid for <br /> the lcp , we used monoolein ( 9.9 mag ) which consists of an 18 carbon <br /> fatty acid with a cis double bond between carbons <br /> 9 and 10 in ester linkage to the primary hydroxyl of glycerol ( figure 1a ) .<br />simulation times reported are effective <br /> times , taking into consideration typical for martini force - field based <br /> coarse - grained simulations factor of 4 .<br />simulations with protein were initiated <br /> from self - assembled lipid diamond cubic phase of 500 lipids by replicating <br /> the monoolein / water system 27 times ( 3 times in positive and negative x , y , z directions ) and inserting rhodopsin randomly into <br /> the expanded lcp phase .<br />in the first phase of the study<br />, we conducted extensive self - assembly <br /> simulations of randomly mixed cg 9.9 mag lipids and water molecules <br /> into a lipidic diamond cubic phase .<br />as listed in table 1 and detailed in the results , the diamond lipid phase was <br /> successfully achieved in multiple simulations conducted at 20 c <br /> temperature and 40% ( w / w ) water weight percent .<br />all the self - assembly <br /> simulations ( see table 1 ) were initiated from <br /> a random placement of 500 cg 9.9 mags ( a number that is within the <br /> experimentally determined range of 9.9 mag molecules in the unit cell <br /> of the diamond cubic phase ) , and a corresponding number ( determined <br /> by the desired percentage ) of cg water beads in a cubic box .<br />each <br /> system was first equilibrated for a short period of time with the <br /> isotropic pressure coupling scheme and the lennard - jones ( lj ) parameters <br /> of all the atoms set to those of the beads representing water molecules <br /> in the martini force - field .<br />this setup , implemented as well in earlier <br /> cg self - assembly simulations of the lcp , allowed efficient adaptation of the volume of the simulation box <br /> to the number of cg molecules in the system , and ensured complete <br /> mixing of lipids and waters prior to self - assembly simulation .<br />after this initial equilibration phase ,<br />the lj parameters for 9.9 <br /> mag lipids were reset to their proper values ( see details of force - field <br /> parametrization , below ) , and 6 s - long self - assembly md simulations <br /> were performed ( the simulation times reported throughout are effective <br /> times , taking into consideration the <br /> factor of 4 typical for martini force - field - based coarse - grained simulations ) , <br /> and using isotropic pressure coupling ( with 3.0 ps and 3e bar time constant and compressibility , respectively ) , <br /> and a 30 fs time step .<br />to simulate rhodopsin in the diamond phase<br />, we constructed the system <br /> by replicating 27 times ( along positive and negative x , y , <br /> z directions ) one of the cubic phase structures obtained <br /> from the self - assembly simulations conducted at 20 c and at <br /> 40% ( w / w ) water .<br />the diamond cubic phase in this enlarged construct <br /> remained stable in a microsecond - long cg md simulation ( data not shown ) .<br />a rhodopsin molecule was inserted at a random position in this large <br /> cubic phase ( at 122:1 9.9mag / rhodopsin molar ratio , corresponding <br /> to 4 mg / ml concentration , see figure s1 in the supporting information ) .<br />after removing overlapping waters <br /> and 9.9 mag molecules and adding counterions for electroneutrality , <br /> a 4.8 s - long cg md simulation was carried out at 20 c .<br />the total number of cg beads in this large construct was 139  979 , <br /> which corresponds to 1  400  000 actual <br /> atoms .<br />the simulation utilized the isotropic pressure coupling <br /> scheme as above , and a 30 fs time step .<br />rhodopsin <br /> was simulated in 9.9 mag lipid lamellar bilayers with the cg martini <br /> force - field .<br />the cg model of rhodopsin ( see below ) was inserted into <br /> a pre - equilibrated cg 9.9 mag lipid membrane containing 1772 lipids , <br /> and after solvation and ionization steps , a 3.2 s - long md simulation <br /> was carried out at 20 c temperature using a 40 fs integration <br /> time step and the semi - isotropic pressure coupling scheme .<br />the details of the martini cg <br /> force fields and the parametrization scheme employed for 9.9 mag lipid <br /> and rhodopsin can be found in the supporting methods section of supporting information .<br />the residual exposure energy is the energy <br /> cost of the hydrophobic mismatch that persists in the equilibrium <br /> state of the membrane - protein interaction , even after membrane remodeling <br /> around multi - tm proteins has taken place to reduce the hydrophobic <br /> mismatch .<br />this result <br /> of the anisotropy of the protein  membrane boundary when multi - tm <br /> proteins are inserted in the bilayer has been discussed in detail . for rhodopsin , the residual exposure of residues in the tm segments <br /> was quantified with the computational protocol described in ref ( 30 ) in both the lipid cubic <br /> and lamellar phases , using solvent accessible surface area ( sasa )<br />calculations with the naccess software and a probe radius of 1.4  .<br />as described previously , sasa values <br /> were obtained either with the solute comprising the protein only ( saprot ) , or with the solute containing the protein and the hydrophobic <br /> core of the lipid bilayer ( samem)the latter being <br /> defined as the 9.9 mag bilayer region consisting of the gl1-c1a - c2a - d3a - c4a - c5a <br /> cg beads ( see above for the cg bead definition , depicted in figure 1a ) .<br />the residual exposure sares was then <br /> calculated as sares = saprot  samem for polar residues and as sares = samem for hydrophobic residues ( see ref ( 30 ) for details ) .<br />these accessible surface <br /> values were used to obtain the residual mismatch energy penalty gres associated with a particular residue as <br /> gres = ressares , where res = 0.028 kcal/(mol ) is a constant of proportionality related to the free energy <br /> of transfer of amino acids between aqueous and lipid environments .<br />according to a well - accepted protocol , interfacial trp , arg , and<br />lys residues were not penalized for residual <br /> mismatch due to their ability to adapt favorably to hydrophobic / hydrophilic <br /> interfaces .<br />for a quantitative assessment of the spatial organization of the <br /> bicontinuous lipid / water structures assembled computationally , we <br /> utilized an analytical fit of the data obtained from the simulations .<br />to obtain this fit we represented the location of the lipid bilayer <br /> midplane of the bicontinuous cubic phase by the triply periodic minimal <br /> surface ( tpms , surface with zero mean curvature):1where f(x , y , z ,  )<br />is the improved nodal approximation given by:2with3 and x = x , y =<br />y , z = z , and p , q , r =<br />c , s ( c and s stand for cosine and sine , respectively ) .<br />the { h , k , l } in the above equations are the crystallographic miller <br /> indices , and  is a fitting parameter such that 1/ represents<br />the linear size of the primitive unit cell .<br />this surface was shown <br /> to provide an accurate representation of the surface in the pn3 m symmetry group ( see , for example , ref ( 3 ) and citations therein ) .<br />for each 9.9mag / water trajectory listed in table 1 , a fit to the analytical solution was performed on 20 separate <br /> frames spaced 350 ns apart .<br />to this end<br />we extracted the coordinates <br /> { xi } of n c5a coarse - grained beads representing the location of <br /> the terminal methylene and methyl groups in the hydrocarbon tail of <br /> 9.9 mag lipids for each frame , and the fit was done by optimizing f(xi ,  ) =<br />ci through <br /> a search for the translational and rotational transformations that <br /> minimized  =<br />( 1/n)i=1ci .<br />the quality of the fit was assessed from <br /> the distribution of { ci } values obtained from the minimization procedure ; this distribution <br /> is centered around the theoretical mean , zero ( i.e. , the analytical <br /> solution of eq 1 ) .<br />such a distribution was collected <br /> for each md trajectory by merging the { ci } coefficients obtained from fitting all 20 separate <br /> frames , and the quality was assessed as described above ( see distribution <br /> plots and captions in figure 4 and in figure <br /> s3 in the supporting information ) .<br />to compare quantitatively the structural arrangement <br /> of the lcp bilayer near the protein , to that in the bulk cubic phase , <br /> we employed two complementary approaches .<br />in the first , we obtained <br /> an analytical solution for the lipid bilayer midplane around the protein <br /> by fitting the simulation data ( coordinates of c5a beads ) to f(x , y , z ,  ) =<br />ci , as described above in the tpms representation , <br /> except that for this purpose the { ci } coefficients were also considered as variable parameters <br /> that must be self - consistently minimized ( see above ) .<br />in this manner<br />, <br /> the extent of the deviation of the mean value of the { ci } distribution obtained from the solution <br /> for the pn3 m phase ( ci  0 , see above ) , <br /> measures the distortion of the diamond cubic phase due to the protein .<br />the alternative approach we developed for quantifying the perturbation <br /> of lipid bilayer shape induced by the gpcr departs from the symmetry <br /> group definition and focuses on the lipid  water boundary .<br />in <br /> this approach ,<br />different trajectory frames from the simulation of <br /> rhodopsin in lcp are aligned onto snapshots from the simulations of <br /> the large protein - depleted 9.9 mag / water system .<br />using a locally defined <br /> scoring function ( see below ) , we assess how well the lipid bilayers <br /> of the protein - containing and protein - free systems align ( the large <br /> protein - free system was constructed by replicating 27 times the equilibrated <br /> system composed of 500 9.9 mag lipids/6800 water molecules , and subjecting <br /> it to microsecond long cg md simulation during which the pn3 m phase was maintained ; data not shown ) .<br />to align the protein - free <br /> and protein - containing structures , we <br /> used water densities to first align 10 frames from the last 100 ns <br /> of the protein - free simulation , which served as a reference on which <br /> we aligned 10 frames from the last 100 ns of the protein - containing <br /> trajectory .<br />only water beads at least 50  away from the protein <br /> were considered , in order to avoid degradation of the alignment quality <br /> due to deformations of the lipid cubic phase near the protein .<br />the alignments utilized the electron density (y ) at any point y of a set of beads with coordinates <br /> ri ; the density function was constructed <br /> as a superposition of gaussians , so that for a particular trajectory <br /> frame4where c and k are the amplitude and width of the gaussians , respectively , chosen <br /> to produce a 10  resolution density map .<br />the quality of the superposition of two frames was <br /> estimated by <br /> measuring the overlap of the water - containing and water - free regions <br /> using:5where x = { xj } ( j = 1,2, ... ,m1 , m1 + 1, ... ,n ) are coordinates of beads in <br /> the fitted frame which contains m1 water <br /> beads and n  m1 lipid beads ; w is the density <br /> of water in the reference frame obtained using eq 5 ; sj = 1 for j  m1 , and sj = 1 for j > m1 .<br />the best alignment was calculated by maximizing s with respect to the rotational and translational transformations <br /> applied to x. the local quality of the alignment <br /> was assessed by a normalized <br /> scoring function defined as:6where (xj ) represents the electron density of the <br /> beads in the reference frame .<br />the self - assembly of the 9.9 mag / water complex <br /> with 40% ( w / w ) water composition was probed at 20 c , which are <br /> conditions similar to those used in the original in meso crystallization trials of gpcr proteins ( see ref ( 14 ) and citations therein ) .<br />figures 2 and 3 show several views of <br /> 9.9 mag / water complexes obtained under these conditions produced by <br /> the 6 s - long self - assembly simulation of 500 9.9 mag lipids .<br />in figure 2 , panels a  c offer views <br /> of the unit simulation cell , whereas figure 3 depicts various snapshots of the same system replicated 27 times <br /> ( 3 times in each orthogonal direction ) .<br />typically , in our simulations <br /> the initially randomly mixed 9.9 mag / water system became organized <br /> as illustrated in figures 23 within the first 350 ns of simulation , and remained <br /> stable for the remainder of the 6 s trajectory .<br />( a , b ) views of the unit <br /> simulation cell containing 9.9 mag / water <br /> complex at 40% ( w / w ) water concentration and at 20 c temperature , <br /> after 6 s of self - assembly simulation .<br />( a ) entire system where <br /> different components are colored as following : 9.9 mag lipid headgroup <br /> beads , blue ; 9.9 mag lipid hydrocarbon tail beads , red ; and water <br /> beads , cyan .<br />( b ) separately 9.9 mag hydrocarbon chain beads from the <br /> same perspective as in a. ( c ) view of the tetrahedral arrangement <br /> of the water channel from a. the four arms of the tetrahedral geometry <br /> are visible .<br />( d ) snapshot of two nonintersecting continuous intertwined <br /> water channels ( in gold and cyan , respectively ) .<br />the representations <br /> are for the  expanded  system obtained by replicating <br /> the simulated system 9 times ( in positive x , y , and z directions ) .<br />views of the 9.9 mag / water complex from figure 2 replicated 27 times ( 3 times in positive and negative x , y , and z directions ) reveal bicontinuous <br /> diamond cubic phase nature of the self - assembled structure .<br />different <br /> panels show : the entire system ( a ) , 9.9 mag headgroup and water cg<br />beads ( b ) , 9.9 mag hydrocarbon chain beads ( c ) , only water beads ( d ) .<br />the bicontinuous cubic phase nature of the self - assembled <br /> structure <br /> is apparent from inspection of the spatial organization of both lipid <br /> and water components .<br />indeed , the hydrophobic core of the 9.9 mag <br /> lipids ( shown in red in figures 23 ) traces a single highly curved continuous surface <br /> in 3d , surrounded by 9.9 mag headgroups ( dark blue shades in figures 23 ) adjacent to aqueous <br /> compartments ( cyan colors in figures 2a , c and 3 ) .<br />the aqueous part of the system consists of two <br /> nonintersecting three - dimensional continuous networks of water channels <br /> ( figure 2d ) , which makes the assembled structure <br /> a bicontinuous cubic phase .<br />figure 2c <br /> shows that in each of the water <br /> compartments four aqueous channels meet in a tetrahedral arrangement .<br />a similar arrangement can be observed as well for the surface traced <br /> by the hydrocarbon chains of 9.9 mag lipids ( see figures 2b and 3c ) .<br />thus , the assembled structure <br /> resembles closely the doubly bicontinuous lipidic diamond cubic phase .<br />one general feature of such mesophases is that the surface traced <br /> by the midplane of the lipid bilayer , which separates the two aqueous <br /> compartments , can be approximated by the triply periodic minimal surface <br /> ( tpms ) that has a special property : it is characterized at every point <br /> by zero mean curvature .<br />consequently , the tpms is saddle - shaped ( figure <br /> s2 , supporting information ) .<br />this saddle - shaped <br /> geometry of the 9.9 mag / water assembly resulting from our calculations <br /> can be appreciated , for example , by tracing the surface formed by <br /> the 9.9 mag hydrophobic core ( see figures 23 ) .<br />for a quantitative assessment <br /> of the adherence of the bicontinuous <br /> structure from our simulations to the organization of the pn3 m diamond cubic phase<br />, we performed a fit of the simulation <br /> data to the analytical solution , as described in methods .<br />the quality of the fit was assessed quantitatively <br /> from the distribution of the fitting coefficients { ci } ( see methods ) shown in figure 4 .<br />clearly , the distribution is centered around zero mean , and is <br /> relatively narrow ( with a standard deviation of 0.4 ) , suggesting <br /> that the surface traced by the c5a beads is consistent with the tpms <br /> of the pn3 m cubic phase ( see eqs 13 ) .<br />distribution of { ci } coefficients from the fitting <br /> of the c5a bead positions from the <br /> simulations to the analytical tpms approximation ( see methods ) .<br />the  test established the significance of the fit <br /> with probability p < 0.05 .<br />as indicated in table 1 , <br /> the self - assembly <br /> of 9.9 mag / water mixture was investigated in two additional simulations <br /> performed at t =<br />20 c and 40% ( w / w ) water content .<br />in all cases 9.9<br />mag and water molecules aggregated in doubly bicontinuous <br /> diamond lipid cubic phases , similar to that described in figures 23 ( see figure s3 <br /> in the supporting information ) .<br />to explore the organization <br /> of a gpcr inside the cubic mesophase we simulated the prototypical <br /> class - a gpcr , rhodopsin , in 9.9 mag - containing lipidic cubic phase <br /> in a large system constructed as described in methods .<br />the simulation results were used as described below to compare <br /> quantitatively the interactions of rhodopsin with bilayers of the <br /> cubic and lamellar phases , as a basis for interpreting the mechanistic <br /> role of the hydrophobic mismatch in triggering the nucleation process <br /> during the in - meso crystallization .<br />residues in the rhodopsin tm bundle that participate <br /> in unfavorable interfacial hydrophobic / hydrophilic interactions with <br /> the lipid bilayers of the cubic and lamellar phase were identified , <br /> as described in methods , with a sasa - based <br /> approach .<br />the last 1.5 s intervals <br /> from the respective cg md trajectories for rhodopsin in the 9.9 mag <br /> lcp ( 4.8 s ) , and in the 9.9 mag lipid lamellar phase ( for 3.2 <br /> s ) were used for the residual exposure analysis ( see methods for definitions ) , and the corresponding <br /> residual exposure energies were evaluated as described .<br />table 2 lists rhodopsin<br />tm residues that were found to exhibit different hydrophobic exposures <br /> in the lcp and lamellar phase simulations , alongside their respective <br /> residual exposure energy penalties ( gres ) .<br />all other residues in the tm bundle experienced a residual <br /> penalty of < 1 kbt ( kb denoting the boltzmann constant ) in both lpc <br /> and lamellar phases .<br />analysis was carried out on the <br /> last 1.5 s time interval of the respective trajectories where <br /> sasa values and corresponding residual exposure energies remained , <br /> within fluctuations , unchanged .<br />numbering shown in parentheses corresponds <br /> to the generic residue numbering scheme for gpcrs defined by ballesteros <br /> and weinstein .<br />different residual exposure in the two lipid environments <br /> became <br /> evident for residues in the extracellular ( ec ) end of tmh1 , and the <br /> intracellular side ( ic ) of tmh5 ( table 2 ) .<br />specifically , the pro34/gln36 pair on <br /> tmh1 ( superscript numbers identify the residues by the ballesteros <br /> and weinstein generic residue numbering scheme for gpcrs ) , and phe228 in tmh5 were found <br /> to generate a lower residual exposure energy penalty in the lcp than <br /> in the lamellar phase .<br />especially remarkable is the difference in <br /> gres for the hydrophobic pro34 residue , that is , 4.7 kbt in the lamellar bilayers , but < 1 kbt in the cubic phase .<br />this difference <br /> results from pro34 being largely exposed to the lipid <br /> polar headgroups and/or water environment in the planar membrane , <br /> but shielded from such unfavorable interactions in the lcp .<br />the large residual exposure predicted for pro34 in <br /> the lamellar 9.9 mag bilayers is consistent with findings from our <br /> earlier all - atom md simulations of rhodopsin in planar membranes composed <br /> of dicn:1pc ( n = 14 , 16 , 18 , 20 ) lipids ; <br /> the largest residual exposure for pro34 was found in <br /> the bilayers with the thinnest hydrophobic core , that is , dic14:1pc and dic16:1pc membranes .<br />due to the substantial <br /> difference between the hydrophobic length of tmh1 in rhodopsin ( 37  , measured along <br /> the membrane normal )<br />and the bulk hydrophobic thickness of the thinner bilayers ( 27.2 <br /> and 30.5  , respectively for dic14:1pc and dic16:1pc membranes ) , the mismatch was <br /> not alleviated by membrane deformations around the protein ( see ref ( 30 ) ) .<br />here<br />, the hydrophobic <br /> thickness of the 9.9 mag lamellar bilayers , calculated from the average <br /> distance between the lipid gl1 backbone beads on the two leaflets , <br /> is 31.5  , so that the hydrophobic mismatch between tmh1 and <br /> the bilayer is again substantial , and can be alleviated only partially <br /> by membrane deformation , as shown below .<br />the average thickness <br /> of the 9.9 mag lamellar bilayer around rhodopsin , <br /> calculated from the last 1.5 s of the md trajectory and the <br /> membrane thinning around tmh2the helix adjacent to tmh1is <br /> evident in figure 5 .<br />interestingly , we find <br /> that the bilayer deforms near the polar ser98 residue <br /> ( see figure 5d ) , which is apparently shielded <br /> from the unfavorable exposure to the hydrophobic lipid core by the <br /> local thinning of the lipid membrane .<br />usually , the membrane - facing<br />oh of ser residues in a tm bundle can avoid hydrophobic contact <br /> by forming hydrogen bonds with the helix backbone .<br />when this is not <br /> feasible energetically , the bilayer thins around this residue .<br />in <br /> our simulations<br />we find that in order to shield ser98 from unfavorable hydrophobic exposure , the thinning at tmh2 also <br /> constrains the lipids at the adjacent tmh1 ( see ref ( 30 ) for a discussion of this <br /> type of constraint ) , so that the membrane can not deform significantly <br /> and thus leaves the pro34 residue highly exposed ( see <br /> figure 5d and table 2 ) .<br />( a  c ) views of membrane deformation patterns around the <br /> rhodopsin immersed into 9.9 mag lamellar bilayers .<br />the average positioning <br /> of membrane leaflets is identified by the two surfaces colored according <br /> to the local thickness of the bilayer ( see the bar for color definition ) .<br />the gpcr is shown in van der waals representation with the tm helices <br /> colored as follows : tm1 in gray , tm2 in orange , tm3 in white , tm4 <br /> in pink , tm5 in purple , tm6 in black , and tm7 in lime the rest of <br /> the protein ( loops , etc . )<br />( d ) magnified view of the <br /> region containing residues pro34 and ser98 ( both rendered in green ) showing the membrane deformations in their <br /> vicinity .<br />figure 5 shows that the <br /> 9.9 mag planar bilayer <br /> deforms around other tm helices as well .<br />specifically , the membrane <br /> thins around tmh4 , alleviating the residual mismatch for this helix , <br /> and around tmh7 where the deformation efficiently accommodates the <br /> juxtaposed amphipathic helix 8 at the hydrophobic / hydrophilic interface .<br />overall , the heterogeneous pattern of membrane deformations we observe <br /> around rhodopsin in the current simulations agrees with earlier findings <br /> from all - atom md simulations showing the pattern of membrane remodeling <br /> around rhodopsin and the homologous serotonin 5-ht2a gpcr .<br />consistent with those studies , <br /> we find here that the deformations of the lamellar 9.9 mag bilayer <br /> do not completely alleviate the hydrophobic mismatch with the receptor <br /> ( table 2 ) .<br />the different organization of the <br /> two lipid phases around the gpcr , as presented below , explains why <br /> the residual exposure was larger for rhodopsin in the lamellar 9.9 <br /> mag bilayer than in the 9.9 mag lcp .<br />figure 6 shows the <br /> organization of the lipid cubic phase around rhodopsin in the initial <br /> configuration where the protein was randomly inserted in the lcp ( see <br /> also figure s1 in the supporting information ) , compared to the organization after 4.8 s of cg md simulations .<br />c with d  f in figure 6 shows the substantial rearrangement of the lipids and solvent <br /> around rhodopsin during the long md trajectory .<br />specifically , it appears <br /> that the lcp tends to minimize hydrophobic / hydrophilic contacts with <br /> the gpcr as the water and lipid headgroup beads organize around polar <br /> regions of the protein ( yellow colors in figure 6 ) , whereas the lipid hydrocarbon chain beads surround the hydrophobic <br /> core of the protein ( see caption of figure 6 for tm definitions ) .<br />snapshots illustrating initial ( a  c ) , and final <br /> ( after 4.8 <br /> s simulations ) positioning ( d  f ) of rhodopsin ( in yellow / white )<br />inside the cubic phase .<br />a and d show the organization of water beads<br />( in cyan ) , b and e illustrate the organization of 9.9 mag lipid headgroup<br />beads ( in pink ) , and c and f show the organization of 9.9 mag lipid <br /> hydrophobic core beads ( in purple ) .<br />in all panels<br />rhodopsin transmembrane <br /> ( tm ) helices are colored in white and the rest of the protein in yellow .<br />shown are only water and 9.9 mag lipids that are within 20  <br /> of rhodopsin ; rhodopsin is oriented so that its intracellular and <br /> extracellular ends ( as defined in the lipid bilayer ) point toward <br /> the bottom and top of the panels , respectively .<br />the snapshots in figure 6 also show that <br /> rhodopsin equilibrates , as expected , around the saddle - point inside <br /> the lcp so that the tm bundle perpendicularly <br /> traverses a narrow but relatively flattened region of the lcp bilayer , <br /> much like the gpcr protein does in the lamellar bilayers .<br />however , <br /> due to continuous and intrinsically saddle - shaped geometry of the <br /> diamond cubic phase , the lcp bilayer is dramatically curved near tmh1 <br /> and tmh5 , which effectively confines the protein to a small region <br /> of the lcp .<br />this special arrangement of the cubic mesophase around <br /> rhodopsin shields the gpcr in the lcp from the kind of unfavorable <br /> hydrophobic / hydrophilic interactions with the lipid bilayer seen in <br /> the lamellar membranes .<br />thus , as illustrated in figure s4 ( in the supporting information ) and reflected in the <br /> residual energy penalties ( in table 2 ) , residues <br /> pro34 and phe228 are in contact with <br /> the hydrophobic core of the lcp bilayer and therefore do not incur <br /> a residual mismatch penalty , although gln36 experiences <br /> somewhat higher residual exposure in the lcp compared to the lamellar <br /> phase ( see figure s4 and table 2 ) .<br />glamellar to be 2.7 kbt for the pro34/gln36 pair , and 1.8 kbt for phe228 ( table 2 ) .<br />notably , the shielding of ser98 that faced the 9.9 mag lipid bilayer in the lamellar phase <br /> simulations , occurs in the lcp simulations through interaction with <br /> the protein backbone .<br />to relate the calculated residual mismatch <br /> energies to the organization <br /> of the lipidic cubic mesophase around the gpcr , we quantitatively <br /><br />compared the structural arrangement of the lcp bilayer near the protein , <br /> to that in the bulk cubic phase .<br />as described in methods ,<br />two different approaches were used : in the first , <br /> we obtained an analytical fit of the lipid bilayer midplane shape <br /> around the protein by fitting the coordinates of 9.9 mag lipid c5a <br /> methyl terminus beads ( figure 1a ) from the <br /> simulations to f(x , y , z ,  ) =<br />ci , considering <br /> { ci } coefficients as <br /> variable parameters that must be minimized during the fitting ( see methods ) .<br />the application of this procedure to spherical <br /> lipid shells situated at different distances from rhodopsin ( see figure 7a ) revealed that the organization of the lcp close <br /> to the gpcr is different from that expected for the pn3 m lipid bilayer ( ci  0 in figure 7a ) .<br />however , <br /> already at distances 50  from the center of rhodopsin <br /> ( compare to 3540  linear dimension of a rhodopsin - like <br /> gpcr in bilayer x  y plane directions ) , the <br /> simulated structure relaxes to the organization of the diamond cubic <br /> phase ( ci <br /> = 0 , figure 7a ) .<br />the second approach confirms <br /> that the distorted lcp bilayer near the protein tends to relax toward <br /> the pn3 m phase arrangement at larger distances ( figure 7b ) .<br />in this alternative approach<br />we locally quantify <br /> the shape of the lipid bilayer around the gpcr by aligning trajectory <br /> frames from the simulation of rhodopsin in lcp onto snapshots from <br /> the simulations of the pure lcp system , so as to optimize the overlap <br /> of the water - containing and water - free regions ( see methods ) .<br />a scoring function defined locally ( see eq 5 ) is used to assess the quality of the alignment .<br />as seen from figure 7b , this procedure revealed <br /> that the fit between the densities of c5a lipid beads in protein - containing <br /> and protein - free systems progressively improves with the radial distance <br /> from the gpcr ( increasing s in figure 7b ) .<br />indeed , consistent with the result in figure 7a , the scoring function reaches its plateau 50  <br /> away from the protein , indicating that at these distances the lcp <br /> arrangement becomes similar to that expected for the pn3 m phase .<br />distance dependence of the relaxation of membrane deformation near <br /> rhodopsin in the cubic phase .<br />( a ) analytical fit of the density of <br /> c5a 9.9 mag lipid beads from cg md simulation of rhodopsin in the <br /> lcp phase to the surface defined by the f(x , y , z ,  ) =<br />ci equation ( see methods ) .<br />the mean values <br /> of the { ci } fitting coefficient <br /> distribution as a function of r , are shown for 10 <br />  spherical lipid shells located at r = 20 , 30 , 40 , and 50  away the protein center - of - mass .<br />( b ) reasults from the same measurements performed with an alternative <br /> approach based on the alignment of the lipid bilayer midplane in protein - containing <br /> and protein - free cubic phases ( see methods ) .<br />the quality of the fit upon alignment was determined for 10  <br /> spherical lipid shells located at distances r from <br /> the protein center - of - mass , and the panel shows the dependence of <br /> the scoring function s on r. note <br /> that the deformed cubic phase near rhodopsin relaxes to the arrangement <br /> that is characteristic of the pn3 m phase 50 <br />  away from the protein .<br />taken together , our results establish a quantitative <br /> link between <br /> the residual mismatch penalty and the lipid bilayer deformations around <br /> the gpcr in the cubic phase .<br />thus , the areas where the largest perturbations <br /> from the diamond cubic phase were observed included residues pro34 and phe228 ( see figure s5 in the supporting material ) , which are also the residues <br /> with the largest value of glcp  <br /> glamellar ( table 2 ) .<br />the main findings from this study offer <br /> unprecedented insight into <br /> molecular level processes related to in meso crystallization , <br /> which are likely leading to protein nucleation and eventually to crystal <br /> growth .<br />thus , we found that the difference in the hydrophobic / hydrophilic <br /> exposure of the protein to the lipid bilayers of 9.9 mag lcp and lamellar <br /> phases is responsible for a lower residual mismatch ( and its corresponding <br /> energy penalty ) in the cubic mesophase compared to the lamellar membranes .<br />this indicates why gpcrs reconstituted into the lcp in the initial <br /> stages of the in meso trial are well accommodated <br /> inside the cubic phase , where they are believed to reside mostly in <br /> the monomeric form .<br />indeed , from our findings there is insignificant <br /> drive toward rhodopsin oligomerization in the lcp .<br />we showed , however , <br /> why this drive is increased in the planar bilayer environment of the <br /> lamellar phase where there are several critical mechanistic factors <br /> that determine the probability for proteins to oligomerize .<br />one important <br /> energy component that has been established from both experiments and computations , involves the hydrophobic mismatch .<br />in particular , a plausible mechanism to relieve the energy penalty <br /> due to residual exposure is protein oligomerization , whereby the tm <br /> segments incurring the highest energy penalty from the residual exposure <br /> come together in the lipid bilayer .<br />for <br /> such hydrophobic - mismatch driven association to occur<br />, the <br /> residual exposure penalty alleviated by the protein association must <br /> counteract other critical factors that could favor proteins in the <br /> monomeric state .<br />one such important consideration is the mobility <br /> of proteins , because constrained diffusion reduces the chance for <br /> protein  protein encounter .<br />as shown in figure 8 , the spatial restriction encountered by the gpcr inside the <br /> lcp<br />( see figure 6 ) significantly affects protein <br /> mobility , with the diffusion coefficient of the gpcr in the cubic <br /> phase being smaller ( dlcp = 1.1  <br /> 10 m / sec ) than that in the lamellar <br /> bilayers ( dlamellar = 5.5  10 m / sec ) .<br />the restricted diffusion mode <br /> for rhodopsin in the lcp environment is consistent with the suggested <br /> high energy cost in the lcp for gpcr - sized proteins to cross between <br /> different regions of the mesophase .<br />this <br /> energy penalty was quantified from phenomenological principles to <br /> be as high as 1220 kbt in the pn3 m phase with lattice parameter values in the 75110  <br /> range .<br />this estimated energy cost of protein <br /> diffusion in the lcp is significantly higher than the residual mismatch <br /> penalty we calculated for rhodopsin in the cubic phase ( table 2 ) .<br />when considered together , the relatively low <br /> residual exposure energy for the gpcr in the lcp is not likely to <br /> be sufficient to compensate for the high energy barrier for protein <br /> mobility in the lcp and drive protein association .<br />the prediction <br /> is , therefore , that in the cubic mesophase gpcr proteins will remain <br /> largely in the monomeric state .<br />mean - square - displacement ( msd ) as a function of <br /> time calculated for rhodopsin in the 9.9 mag lipidic cubic phase ( lcp ) <br /> and in the 9.9 mag lamellar membrane ( lamellar ) .<br />corresponding diffusion <br /> coefficient values , calculated from the linear fit performed in [ 0 <br /> s;1 s ] time interval , are dlcp =<br />1.1  10 m / sec and dlamellar =<br />5.5  10 m / sec .<br />in contrast to the lcp , the lamellar membrane environment <br /> is more <br /> favorable for gpcr oligomerization : the residual energy penalty for <br /> the rhodopsin tm bundle in the lamellar bilayers is 8 kbt ( table 2 ) and is significantly higher compared to that in the lcp , <br /> indicating a stronger drive for gpcr oligomerization in the lamellar <br /> membranes .<br />a higher propensity for association in the planar bilayers <br /> is also supported by our calculations of the protein mobility in the <br /> two lipid environments , whereby we find a 5-fold larger diffusion <br /> coefficient for the gpcr in the lamellar bilayers ( figure 8) .<br />taken together , results from our simulations <br /> suggest that planar <br /> 9.9 mag lipid membranes provide a more suitable setting for oligomerization <br /> of the gpcr proteins .<br />notably , this prediction is based on results <br /> for oligomerization in a plane of the lipid bilayer .<br />this 2d nucleation <br /> process together with the formation of protein - enriched lamellar stacks <br /> in 3d should ultimately drive the emergence <br /> of a bulk crystal .<br />the question remains regarding the mechanism <br /> that drives the proteins <br /> from the lcp to the lamellar membranes and the potential role of the <br /> differential residual interactions between the protein and the bilayers <br /> of the two lipidic phases in the nucleation process .<br />we note that <br /> the nucleation is triggered by the addition of the precipitant which <br /> is known to cause transient water depletion from the lcp interior , resulting in structural changes in the cubic <br /> phase bilayer .<br />our current study has not attempted to quantify the <br /> effects of the precipitant , but it is reasonable to speculate that <br /> dehydration of the cubic phase will only increase the unfavorable <br /> residual interactions between the gpcr and the lcp bilayer .<br />this is likely to increase the drive for protein <br /> oligomerization inside the lcp upon precipitant addition , which could <br /> lead to the formation of locally flattened lamellar bilayers as a <br /> prelude to protein crystallization .<br />in order to address quantitatively <br /> the structural perturbations due to precipitant , such as changes in <br /> curvature of the lcp bilayer ,<br />it is critical to calculate the corresponding <br /> deformation energies in the presence of the protein .<br />however , the <br /> representation of the complex geometry of the lcp around the insertion <br /> ( figures 67 )<br />in the numerical approach developed in the current work for quantifying <br /> the lcp shape ( i.e. , fitting the md data to the analytical solution )<br />is not sufficiently refined to serve in the calculation of reliable <br /> energies<br />we note , however , that recent experimental studies showed that , compared to 9.9 <br /> mag , in meso trials conducted on the gpcr - gs protein <br /> complex with a shorter chain mag analog , 7.7 mag ( acyl chain 14 carbon <br /> atoms long with the cis double bond between carbon atoms 7 and 8) <br /> resulted in better quality crystals .<br />thus , results from our <br /> current studies as well as from recently reported all - atom simulations <br /> of gpcrs in membranes of different thicknesses , explain why 7.7 mag would provide a better platform in <br /> which gpcrs can aggregate more extensively : based on our findings <br /> we can predict that , due to the expected 78  <br /> difference in the hydrophobic thickness of planar 9.9 mag and 7.7 <br /> mag membranes , the residual exposure of the gpcr will be substantially <br /> higher in the thinner 7.7 mag lamellar bilayers . as an example<br />, we <br /> recently reported that the rhodopsin tm bundle will exhibit a 12 kbt higher residual energy penalty <br /> in dic14:1pc than in dic18:1pc bilayers .<br />a more complete quantitative elucidation of <br /> the gpcr nucleation process in relation to the residual mismatch energy <br /> component requires further studies that would take into consideration <br /> the effect of the different precipitants on various lipids .<br />the structurally specific predictions of the regions where the <br /> residual mismatch with lipid bilayers of cubic and lamellar phases <br /> differed for the rhodopsin tm bundle made it possible to probe the <br /> resulting predictions and general character of the findings by examining <br /> crystallographic data .<br />in particular , we showed here that the intracellular <br /> ( ic ) end of tmh1 ( pro34 ) , and<br />the extracellular ( ec ) <br /> part of the tmh5 including phe228 have higher residual <br /> exposure in lamellar membranes , which leads to the prediction ( e.g. , <br /> see shan et al . )<br />that in the planar bilayers <br /> rhodopsin will exhibit strong hydrophobic - mismatch driven tendency <br /> for oligomerization through tmh1 and tmh5 . to assess this hypothesis <br /> in the context of structural information available for gpcrs , we examined <br /> crystallographic contact interfaces for 12 different structures of <br /> rhodopsin - like gpcrs obtained by means of the in meso technology ( 2 receptor  pbd codes : 2rh1 , 3pds , 3sn6 ; a2a receptor  <br /> pdb codes : 3eml , 3qak ; chemokine <br /> cxcr4 receptor  pdb codes : 3odu , 3oe0 , 3oe6 , 3oe8 , 3oe9 ; dopamine d3 receptor <br />  pdb code : 3pbl , and histamine h1 receptor  pdb code : 3rze ) .<br />for all these <br /> gpcr structures , we analyzed the content of the unit crystallographic <br /> cell and quantified for each tm helix ( 1 ) the frequency of its occurrence <br /> at the crystallographic contact interface and ( 2 ) the number of residue <br /> interactions each tm helix forms at the contact interface .<br />canonical  interfaces were considered , <br /> where the crystallographic contacts were formed exclusively through <br /> tm  tm interactions between monomers in parallel orientations .<br />remarkably , we found that tmh1 and tmh5 , the two helices implicated <br /> in the largest residual mismatch in our simulations of rhodopsin with <br /> 9.9 mag lamellar bilayers , contribute to the most common contact interfaces <br /> in the crystallographic structures of the homologous gpcrs .<br />more specifically , <br /> as illustrated in figure s6a ( see supporting information ) , all but 4 of the 14 distinct intermolecular tm <br />tm interfaces <br /> identified in this analysis , involve tmh1 and/or tmh5 . furthermore , <br /> examining the residues involved in the interactions at the contact <br /> interfaces revealed that the tmh1 stretch of residues in positions <br /> 1.291.34 ( that would include pro34 in the homologous <br /> rhodopsin gpcr ) contribute significantly to the formation of the crystallographic <br /> interface .<br />during the final preparation of this manuscript , <br /> two new crystal <br /> structures of rhodopsin - like gpcrs ,<br />the -opioid receptor ( kor ) <br /> and the -opioid receptor ( mor ) were reported to be obtained <br /> by means of in meso crystallization .<br />consistent with the data presented above , the crystallographic interface <br /> of kor consists of tm1 , tm2 and h8 , with the n - terminal end of tm1 <br /> ( region harboring the residue homologous to pro34 in <br /> rhodopsin ) forming extensive dimeric contacts .<br />for mor , two crystallographic <br /> interfaces were reported : the more prominent interface consisted of<br />tm5/tm6 helices with the i256 residue ( aligning with <br /> the residue next to phe228 in rhodopsin ) residing at <br /> the dimer interface , and more limited contacts formed by tm1 , tm2 <br /> and h8 . taken together ,<br />our findings support the mechanistic <br /> inferences <br /> that ( 1 ) the reduced level of hydrophobic mismatch in the lcp is attributable <br /> to the specific highly curved geometry of the cubic phase that provides <br /> for more coverage from unfavorable hydrophobic exposure ; ( 2 ) compared <br /> to the lcp , lamellar structures provide a more favorable setting in <br /> which gpcrs can oligomerize as a prelude to nucleation and crystal <br /> growth ; and ( 3 ) the extent of the residual mismatch penalty is likely <br /> one of the critical mechanistic factors that determines not only the <br /> drive for gpcr proteins to oligomerize during in meso crystallization , but also the structural elements that are likely <br /> to participate in contact interfaces .<br />these findings provide <br /> novel energy - based insights into in meso crystallization <br /> mechanisms and lay a foundation <br /> for future computational explorations involving other class - a gpcrs <br /> toward designing rational approaches for generation of structure - quality <br /> crystals of membrane proteins .", "summary": "recent successes in the crystallographic determination of structures of transmembrane proteins in the g protein - coupled receptor ( gpcr ) family have established the lipidic cubic phase ( lcp ) environment as the medium of choice for growing structure -

grained beads <br /> from the 9.9 mag lipid ( see a ) ; note the cubic phase structure .<br />the <br /> similarity evident in b and c underscores the close relation between <br /> the organization of the c5a beads ( representing the density of terminal <br /> methylene and methyl groups in 9.9 mag lipids ) and the tpms of the pn3 m cubic phase .<br />the rapid pace of new structural data acquisition using the features of the in meso method <br /> underscores the usefulness and success of the technology .<br />thus , structural <br /> information obtained in this manner for several rhodopsin - like gpcrs <br /> ( reviewed in ref ( 6 ) ) and a gpcr - g protein complex , provided <br /> breakthrough insights about the structural basis for signal transduction <br /> through these 7-tm helical proteins .<br />however , the present lack of <br /> a mechanistic understanding , at the molecular level , of the events <br /> that lead to in meso crystallization of membrane <br /> proteins , makes the success of the method somewhat enigmatic and results <br /> in the need for extensive trials to identify specific conditions , <br /> that is , the host and additive lipid , precipitant etc .<br />such in meso trials begin with the target<br />protein <br /> being reconstituted into the lcp , and a hypothetical descriptive mechanism <br /> based on the membrane curvature and hydrophobic mismatch has been <br /> proposed to address <br /> the crucial step during in meso crystallization  the <br /> preferential partitioning of proteins from the lcp to the lamellar <br /> phase .<br />in the original trials ,<br />the lipid used to form the lcp was <br /> monoolein ( 9.9 mag , see figure 1a ) , however <br /> recent experiments have utilized shorter chain analogs of monoolein <br /> as well as mixtures of monoolein with cholesterol ( see refs ( 12 , 18,21)and citations <br /> therein ) .<br />the reconstituted proteins appear to be well - accommodated , <br /> functional , and mobile inside the lcp where they are believed to reside <br /> largely in a monomeric state .<br />the addition of a precipitant <br /> of suitable composition , which is <br /> the next step in the in meso trial , is proposed to <br /> result in local structural and compositional changes in the mesophase <br /> and likely in protein conformation as well , which alter the interactions between the <br /> proteins and the cubic phase lipid bilayer ; ultimately this drives <br /> the preferential partitioning of the proteins into the lamellar phase <br /> that presumably appears within the lcp .<br />the critical aspect of the nucleation and subsequent crystal growth <br /> process that is triggered in this manner , and ultimately determines <br /> the quality of the grown crystals , is that once they have diffused <br /> from the lcp to the lamellar phase the proteins form tight 3d oligomeric <br /> arrays .<br />the oligomerization of <br /> tm proteins in lipid bilayers has generally <br /> been suggested to involve the hydrophobic mismatch effects originating <br /> from the difference in the lengths of the hydrophobic core of the <br /> protein and the surrounding lipid hydrocarbon region .<br />such mismatch effects have been shown from experiments to play a <br /> role not only in the spatial organization but also in the function <br /> of tm proteins , such as the gpcr rhodopsin .<br />the hydrophobic mismatch is considered to drive the membrane to <br /> deform in order to alleviate the energetically unfavorable hydrophilic / hydrophobic <br /> exposure this mismatch entails .<br />when such membrane deformation can not <br /> achieve a complete hydrophobic adaptation , the  residual exposure  <br /> ( or  residual mismatch  ) to unfavorable interactions <br /> gives rise to an unfavorable contribution to the free energy of protein / membrane <br /> interaction .<br />the mitigation of this energy <br /> term through oligomerization has been suggested as an important mechanistic <br /> contribution to membrane - driven oligomerization of multihelical tm <br /> proteins , such as gpcrs , in lipid bilayers .<br />therefore , we investigated the potential role of differential hydrophobic <br /> exposure of such proteins in lipid bilayers of the cubic and lamellar <br /> phases as a possible determinant of the favorable outcome of in meso crystallization trials .<br />here<br />we present the <br /> results of a molecular dynamics - based study <br /> of a gpcr reconstituted into an lcp environment that reveal differences <br /> in the hydrophobic / hydrophilic exposure of the gpcr to lipid <br />the quantitative results <br /> reflect the drive for differential oligomerization behavior of these <br /> proteins in the two lipid environments that essentially define the <br /> end points along the in meso crystallization pathway .<br />with the ability to connect quantitatively the difference in gpcr <br /> oligomerization behavior in the two different media , to the curvature <br /> and mismatch alleviation capabilities of the two environments ,<br />we <br /> are able to predict lipid types that would enhance / diminish the difference <br /> in the residual exposure for a gpcr in the cubic and lamellar phases .<br />given the recognized importance of protein <br />membrane interaction <br /> for the functional properties of gpcrs , molecular dynamics simulation <br /> studies using all - atom and coarse - grained representations have been carried out for the prototypical gpcr , <br /> rhodopsin , in lamellar membranes .<br />to our knowledge<br />the present work <br /> is the first molecular dynamics - based study of a gpcr reconstituted <br /> into the lcp .<br />the results enable quantitative inferences about the <br /> energetically unfavorable hydrophobic  hydrophilic interactions <br /> that differentiate the behaviors of gpcrs in the two different lipid <br /> environments , lcp and lamellar membranes .<br />we attain these insights <br /> from comparative microsecond time - scale coarse - grained simulations <br /> with the martini force - field of rhodopsin in monoolein - based <br /> cubic and lamellar lipid bilayers .<br />using our recently reported computational <br /> framework for quantifying residual mismatch energies from md trajectories<br />, we evaluated the protein - dependent membrane <br /> deformations and their attendant energy cost , and identified specific <br /> tm regions and residues of rhodopsin that exhibit differential hydrophobic <br /> exposure in the lcp and lamellar bilayers .<br />we show that the bilayer <br /> of the lcp more efficiently shields the protein from unfavorable interactions , <br /> and that the reduced level of hydrophobic mismatch in the lcp is attributable <br /> to the specific , highly curved geometry of the cubic phase .<br />better <br /> protection from unfavorable hydrophobic exposure of rhodopsin in the <br /> lcp phase is especially evident for residues in tm helix 1 ( tmh1 ) <br /> and tmh5 .<br />lcp environment , the planar bilayer of the lamellar phase provides <br /> a more favorable setting for gpcr oligomerization as a prelude to <br /> nucleation and crystal growth .<br />thus , our findings provide novel energy - based <br /> insights into driving elements of in meso crystallization <br /> mechanisms and lay the foundation for future quantitative exploration <br /> of rational approaches for the generation of structure - quality crystals <br /> of membrane proteins .<br />coarse - grained ( cg ) md simulations of the lipid <br /> cubic phases ( lcp ) with or without rhodopsin were done with the martini <br /> force field , grouping atoms into coarse - grained <br /> beads ( see figure 1a ) , and the gromacs 3.3.1 <br /> package as listed for the various molecular <br /> constructs in table 1 . as a host lipid for <br /> the lcp , we used monoolein ( 9.9 mag ) which consists of an 18 carbon <br /> fatty acid with a cis double bond between carbons <br /> 9 and 10 in ester linkage to the primary hydroxyl of glycerol ( figure 1a ) .<br />simulation times reported are effective <br /> times , taking into consideration typical for martini force - field based <br /> coarse - grained simulations factor of 4 .<br />simulations with protein were initiated <br /> from self - assembled lipid diamond cubic phase of 500 lipids by replicating <br /> the monoolein / water system 27 times ( 3 times in positive and negative x , y , z directions ) and inserting rhodopsin randomly into <br /> the expanded lcp phase .<br />in the first phase of the study<br />, we conducted extensive self - assembly <br /> simulations of randomly mixed cg 9.9 mag lipids and water molecules <br /> into a lipidic diamond cubic phase .<br />as listed in table 1 and detailed in the results , the diamond lipid phase was <br /> successfully achieved in multiple simulations conducted at 20 c <br /> temperature and 40% ( w / w ) water weight percent .<br />all the self - assembly <br /> simulations ( see table 1 ) were initiated from <br /> a random placement of 500 cg 9.9 mags ( a number that is within the <br /> experimentally determined range of 9.9 mag molecules in the unit cell <br /> of the diamond cubic phase ) , and a corresponding number ( determined <br /> by the desired percentage ) of cg water beads in a cubic box .<br />each <br /> system was first equilibrated for a short period of time with the <br /> isotropic pressure coupling scheme and the lennard - jones ( lj ) parameters <br /> of all the atoms set to those of the beads representing water molecules <br /> in the martini force - field .<br />this setup , implemented as well in earlier <br /> cg self - assembly simulations of the lcp , allowed efficient adaptation of the volume of the simulation box <br /> to the number of cg molecules in the system , and ensured complete <br /> mixing of lipids and waters prior to self - assembly simulation .<br />after this initial equilibration phase ,<br />the lj parameters for 9.9 <br /> mag lipids were reset to their proper values ( see details of force - field <br /> parametrization , below ) , and 6 s - long self - assembly md simulations <br /> were performed ( the simulation times reported throughout are effective <br /> times , taking into consideration the <br /> factor of 4 typical for martini force - field - based coarse - grained simulations ) , <br /> and using isotropic pressure coupling ( with 3.0 ps and 3e bar time constant and compressibility , respectively ) , <br /> and a 30 fs time step .<br />to simulate rhodopsin in the diamond phase<br />, we constructed the system <br /> by replicating 27 times ( along positive and negative x , y , <br /> z directions ) one of the cubic phase structures obtained <br /> from the self - assembly simulations conducted at 20 c and at <br /> 40% ( w / w ) water .<br />the diamond cubic phase in this enlarged construct <br /> remained stable in a microsecond - long cg md simulation ( data not shown ) .<br />a rhodopsin molecule was inserted at a random position in this large <br /> cubic phase ( at 122:1 9.9mag / rhodopsin molar ratio , corresponding <br /> to 4 mg / ml concentration , see figure s1 in the supporting information ) .<br />after removing overlapping waters <br /> and 9.9 mag molecules and adding counterions for electroneutrality , <br /> a 4.8 s - long cg md simulation was carried out at 20 c .<br />the total number of cg beads in this large construct was 139  979 , <br /> which corresponds to 1  400  000 actual <br /> atoms .<br />the simulation utilized the isotropic pressure coupling <br /> scheme as above , and a 30 fs time step .<br />rhodopsin <br /> was simulated in 9.9 mag lipid lamellar bilayers with the cg martini <br /> force - field .<br />the cg model of rhodopsin ( see below ) was inserted into <br /> a pre - equilibrated cg 9.9 mag lipid membrane containing 1772 lipids , <br /> and after solvation and ionization steps , a 3.2 s - long md simulation <br /> was carried out at 20 c temperature using a 40 fs integration <br /> time step and the semi - isotropic pressure coupling scheme .<br />the details of the martini cg <br /> force fields and the parametrization scheme employed for 9.9 mag lipid <br /> and rhodopsin can be found in the supporting methods section of supporting information .<br />the residual exposure energy is the energy <br /> cost of the hydrophobic mismatch that persists in the equilibrium <br /> state of the membrane - protein interaction , even after membrane remodeling <br /> around multi - tm proteins has taken place to reduce the hydrophobic <br /> mismatch .<br />this result <br /> of the anisotropy of the protein  membrane boundary when multi - tm <br /> proteins are inserted in the bilayer has been discussed in detail . for rhodopsin , the residual exposure of residues in the tm segments <br /> was quantified with the computational protocol described in ref ( 30 ) in both the lipid cubic <br /> and lamellar phases , using solvent accessible surface area ( sasa )<br />calculations with the naccess software and a probe radius of 1.4  .<br />as described previously , sasa values <br /> were obtained either with the solute comprising the protein only ( saprot ) , or with the solute containing the protein and the hydrophobic <br /> core of the lipid bilayer ( samem)the latter being <br /> defined as the 9.9 mag bilayer region consisting of the gl1-c1a - c2a - d3a - c4a - c5a <br /> cg beads ( see above for the cg bead definition , depicted in figure 1a ) .<br />the residual exposure sares was then <br /> calculated as sares = saprot  samem for polar residues and as sares = samem for hydrophobic residues ( see ref ( 30 ) for details ) .<br />these accessible surface <br /> values were used to obtain the residual mismatch energy penalty gres associated with a particular residue as <br /> gres = ressares , where res = 0.028 kcal/(mol ) is a constant of proportionality related to the free energy <br /> of transfer of amino acids between aqueous and lipid environments .<br />according to a well - accepted protocol , interfacial trp , arg , and<br />lys residues were not penalized for residual <br /> mismatch due to their ability to adapt favorably to hydrophobic / hydrophilic <br /> interfaces .<br />for a quantitative assessment of the spatial organization of the <br /> bicontinuous lipid / water structures assembled computationally , we <br /> utilized an analytical fit of the data obtained from the simulations .<br />to obtain this fit we represented the location of the lipid bilayer <br /> midplane of the bicontinuous cubic phase by the triply periodic minimal <br /> surface ( tpms , surface with zero mean curvature):1where f(x , y , z ,  )<br />is the improved nodal approximation given by:2with3 and x = x , y =<br />y , z = z , and p , q , r =<br />c , s ( c and s stand for cosine and sine , respectively ) .<br />the { h , k , l } in the above equations are the crystallographic miller <br /> indices , and  is a fitting parameter such that 1/ represents<br />the linear size of the primitive unit cell .<br />this surface was shown <br /> to provide an accurate representation of the surface in the pn3 m symmetry group ( see , for example , ref ( 3 ) and citations therein ) .<br />for each 9.9mag / water trajectory listed in table 1 , a fit to the analytical solution was performed on 20 separate <br /> frames spaced 350 ns apart .<br />to this end<br />we extracted the coordinates <br /> { xi } of n c5a coarse - grained beads representing the location of <br /> the terminal methylene and methyl groups in the hydrocarbon tail of <br /> 9.9 mag lipids for each frame , and the fit was done by optimizing f(xi ,  ) =<br />ci through <br /> a search for the translational and rotational transformations that <br /> minimized  =<br />( 1/n)i=1ci .<br />the quality of the fit was assessed from <br /> the distribution of { ci } values obtained from the minimization procedure ; this distribution <br /> is centered around the theoretical mean , zero ( i.e. , the analytical <br /> solution of eq 1 ) .<br />such a distribution was collected <br /> for each md trajectory by merging the { ci } coefficients obtained from fitting all 20 separate <br /> frames , and the quality was assessed as described above ( see distribution <br /> plots and captions in figure 4 and in figure <br /> s3 in the supporting information ) .<br />to compare quantitatively the structural arrangement <br /> of the lcp bilayer near the protein , to that in the bulk cubic phase , <br /> we employed two complementary approaches .<br />in the first , we obtained <br /> an analytical solution for the lipid bilayer midplane around the protein <br /> by fitting the simulation data ( coordinates of c5a beads ) to f(x , y , z ,  ) =<br />ci , as described above in the tpms representation , <br /> except that for this purpose the { ci } coefficients were also considered as variable parameters <br /> that must be self - consistently minimized ( see above ) .<br />in this manner<br />, <br /> the extent of the deviation of the mean value of the { ci } distribution obtained from the solution <br /> for the pn3 m phase ( ci  0 , see above ) , <br /> measures the distortion of the diamond cubic phase due to the protein .<br />the alternative approach we developed for quantifying the perturbation <br /> of lipid bilayer shape induced by the gpcr departs from the symmetry <br /> group definition and focuses on the lipid  water boundary .<br />in <br /> this approach ,<br />different trajectory frames from the simulation of <br /> rhodopsin in lcp are aligned onto snapshots from the simulations of <br /> the large protein - depleted 9.9 mag / water system .<br />using a locally defined <br /> scoring function ( see below ) , we assess how well the lipid bilayers <br /> of the protein - containing and protein - free systems align ( the large <br /> protein - free system was constructed by replicating 27 times the equilibrated <br /> system composed of 500 9.9 mag lipids/6800 water molecules , and subjecting <br /> it to microsecond long cg md simulation during which the pn3 m phase was maintained ; data not shown ) .<br />to align the protein - free <br /> and protein - containing structures , we <br /> used water densities to first align 10 frames from the last 100 ns <br /> of the protein - free simulation , which served as a reference on which <br /> we aligned 10 frames from the last 100 ns of the protein - containing <br /> trajectory .<br />only water beads at least 50  away from the protein <br /> were considered , in order to avoid degradation of the alignment quality <br /> due to deformations of the lipid cubic phase near the protein .<br />the alignments utilized the electron density (y ) at any point y of a set of beads with coordinates <br /> ri ; the density function was constructed <br /> as a superposition of gaussians , so that for a particular trajectory <br /> frame4where c and k are the amplitude and width of the gaussians , respectively , chosen <br /> to produce a 10  resolution density map .<br />the quality of the superposition of two frames was <br /> estimated by <br /> measuring the overlap of the water - containing and water - free regions <br /> using:5where x = { xj } ( j = 1,2, ... ,m1 , m1 + 1, ... ,n ) are coordinates of beads in <br /> the fitted frame which contains m1 water <br /> beads and n  m1 lipid beads ; w is the density <br /> of water in the reference frame obtained using eq 5 ; sj = 1 for j  m1 , and sj = 1 for j > m1 .<br />the best alignment was calculated by maximizing s with respect to the rotational and translational transformations <br /> applied to x. the local quality of the alignment <br /> was assessed by a normalized <br /> scoring function defined as:6where (xj ) represents the electron density of the <br /> beads in the reference frame .<br />the self - assembly of the 9.9 mag / water complex <br /> with 40% ( w / w ) water composition was probed at 20 c , which are <br /> conditions similar to those used in the original in meso crystallization trials of gpcr proteins ( see ref ( 14 ) and citations therein ) .<br />figures 2 and 3 show several views of <br /> 9.9 mag / water complexes obtained under these conditions produced by <br /> the 6 s - long self - assembly simulation of 500 9.9 mag lipids .<br />in figure 2 , panels a  c offer views <br /> of the unit simulation cell , whereas figure 3 depicts various snapshots of the same system replicated 27 times <br /> ( 3 times in each orthogonal direction ) .<br />typically , in our simulations <br /> the initially randomly mixed 9.9 mag / water system became organized <br /> as illustrated in figures 23 within the first 350 ns of simulation , and remained <br /> stable for the remainder of the 6 s trajectory .<br />( a , b ) views of the unit <br /> simulation cell containing 9.9 mag / water <br /> complex at 40% ( w / w ) water concentration and at 20 c temperature , <br /> after 6 s of self -

assembled structure .<br />different <br /> panels show : the entire system ( a ) , 9.9 mag headgroup and water cg<br />beads ( b ) , 9.9 mag hydrocarbon chain beads ( c ) , only water beads ( d ) .<br />the bicontinuous cubic phase nature of the self - assembled <br /> structure <br /> is apparent from inspection of the spatial organization of both lipid <br /> and water components .<br />indeed , the hydrophobic core of the 9.9 mag <br /> lipids ( shown in red in figures 23 ) traces a single highly curved continuous surface <br /> in 3d , surrounded by 9.9 mag headgroups ( dark blue shades in figures 23 ) adjacent to aqueous <br /> compartments ( cyan colors in figures 2a , c and 3 ) .<br />the aqueous part of the system consists of two <br /> nonintersecting three - dimensional continuous networks of water channels <br /> ( figure 2d ) , which makes the assembled structure <br /> a bicontinuous cubic phase .<br />figure 2c <br /> shows that in each of the water <br /> compartments four aqueous channels meet in a tetrahedral arrangement .<br />a similar arrangement can be observed as well for the surface traced <br /> by the hydrocarbon chains of 9.9 mag lipids ( see figures 2b and 3c ) .<br />thus , the assembled structure <br /> resembles closely the doubly bicontinuous lipidic diamond cubic phase .<br />one general feature of such mesophases is that the surface traced <br /> by the midplane of the lipid bilayer , which separates the two aqueous <br /> compartments , can be approximated by the triply periodic minimal surface <br /> ( tpms ) that has a special property : it is characterized at every point <br /> by zero mean curvature .<br />consequently , the tpms is saddle - shaped ( figure <br /> s2 , supporting information ) .<br />this saddle - shaped <br /> geometry of the 9.9 mag / water assembly resulting from our calculations <br /> can be appreciated , for example , by tracing the surface formed by <br /> the 9.9 mag hydrophobic core ( see figures 23 ) .<br />for a quantitative assessment <br /> of the adherence of the bicontinuous <br /> structure from our simulations to the organization of the pn3 m diamond cubic phase<br />, we performed a fit of the simulation <br /> data to the analytical solution , as described in methods .<br />the quality of the fit was assessed quantitatively <br /> from the distribution of the fitting coefficients { ci } ( see methods ) shown in figure 4 .<br />clearly , the distribution is centered around zero mean , and is <br /> relatively narrow ( with a standard deviation of 0.4 ) , suggesting <br /> that the surface traced by the c5a beads is consistent with the tpms <br /> of the pn3 m cubic phase ( see eqs 13 ) .<br />distribution of { ci } coefficients from the fitting <br /> of the c5a bead positions from the <br /> simulations to the analytical tpms approximation ( see methods ) .<br />the  test established the significance of the fit <br /> with probability p < 0.05 .<br />as indicated in table 1 , <br /> the self - assembly <br /> of 9.9 mag / water mixture was investigated in two additional simulations <br /> performed at t =<br />20 c and 40% ( w / w ) water content .<br />in all cases 9.9<br />mag and water molecules aggregated in doubly bicontinuous <br /> diamond lipid cubic phases , similar to that described in figures 23 ( see figure s3 <br /> in the supporting information ) .<br />to explore the organization <br /> of a gpcr inside the cubic mesophase we simulated the prototypical <br /> class - a gpcr , rhodopsin , in 9.9 mag - containing lipidic cubic phase <br /> in a large system constructed as described in methods .<br />the simulation results were used as described below to compare <br /> quantitatively the interactions of rhodopsin with bilayers of the <br /> cubic and lamellar phases , as a basis for interpreting the mechanistic <br /> role of the hydrophobic mismatch in triggering the nucleation process <br /> during the in - meso crystallization .<br />residues in the rhodopsin tm bundle that participate <br /> in unfavorable interfacial hydrophobic / hydrophilic interactions with <br /> the lipid bilayers of the cubic and lamellar phase were identified , <br /> as described in methods , with a sasa - based <br /> approach .<br />the last 1.5 s intervals <br /> from the respective cg md trajectories for rhodopsin in the 9.9 mag <br /> lcp ( 4.8 s ) , and in the 9.9 mag lipid lamellar phase ( for 3.2 <br /> s ) were used for the residual exposure analysis ( see methods for definitions ) , and the corresponding <br /> residual exposure energies were evaluated as described .<br />table 2 lists rhodopsin<br />tm residues that were found to exhibit different hydrophobic exposures <br /> in the lcp and lamellar phase simulations , alongside their respective <br /> residual exposure energy penalties ( gres ) .<br />all other residues in the tm bundle experienced a residual <br /> penalty of < 1 kbt ( kb denoting the boltzmann constant ) in both lpc <br /> and lamellar phases .<br />analysis was carried out on the <br /> last 1.5 s time interval of the respective trajectories where <br /> sasa values and corresponding residual exposure energies remained , <br /> within fluctuations , unchanged .<br />numbering shown in parentheses corresponds <br /> to the generic residue numbering scheme for gpcrs defined by ballesteros <br /> and weinstein .<br />different residual exposure in the two lipid environments <br /> became <br /> evident for residues in the extracellular ( ec ) end of tmh1 , and the <br /> intracellular side ( ic ) of tmh5 ( table 2 ) .<br />specifically , the pro34/gln36 pair on <br /> tmh1 ( superscript numbers identify the residues by the ballesteros <br /> and weinstein generic residue numbering scheme for gpcrs ) , and phe228 in tmh5 were found <br /> to generate a lower residual exposure energy penalty in the lcp than <br /> in the lamellar phase .<br />especially remarkable is the difference in <br /> gres for the hydrophobic pro34 residue , that is , 4.7 kbt in the lamellar bilayers , but < 1 kbt in the cubic phase .<br />this difference <br /> results from pro34 being largely exposed to the lipid <br /> polar headgroups and/or water environment in the planar membrane , <br /> but shielded from such unfavorable interactions in the lcp .<br />the large residual exposure predicted for pro34 in <br /> the lamellar 9.9 mag bilayers is consistent with findings from our <br /> earlier all - atom md simulations of rhodopsin in planar membranes composed <br /> of dicn:1pc ( n = 14 , 16 , 18 , 20 ) lipids ; <br /> the largest residual exposure for pro34 was found in <br /> the bilayers with the thinnest hydrophobic core , that is , dic14:1pc and dic16:1pc membranes .<br />due to the substantial <br /> difference between the hydrophobic length of tmh1 in rhodopsin ( 37  , measured along <br /> the membrane normal )<br />and the bulk hydrophobic thickness of the thinner bilayers ( 27.2 <br /> and 30.5  , respectively for dic14:1pc and dic16:1pc membranes ) , the mismatch was <br /> not alleviated by membrane deformations around the protein ( see ref ( 30 ) ) .<br />here<br />, the hydrophobic <br /> thickness of the 9.9 mag lamellar bilayers , calculated from the average <br /> distance between the lipid gl1 backbone beads on the two leaflets , <br /> is 31.5  , so that the hydrophobic mismatch between tmh1 and <br /> the bilayer is again substantial , and can be alleviated only partially <br /> by membrane deformation , as shown below .<br />the average thickness <br /> of the 9.9 mag lamellar bilayer around rhodopsin , <br /> calculated from the last 1.5 s of the md trajectory and the <br /> membrane thinning around tmh2the helix adjacent to tmh1is <br /> evident in figure 5 .<br />interestingly , we find <br /> that the bilayer deforms near the polar ser98 residue <br /> ( see figure 5d ) , which is apparently shielded <br /> from the unfavorable exposure to the hydrophobic lipid core by the <br /> local thinning of the lipid membrane .<br />usually , the membrane - facing<br />oh of ser residues in a tm bundle can avoid hydrophobic contact <br /> by forming hydrogen bonds with the helix backbone .<br />when this is not <br /> feasible energetically , the bilayer thins around this residue .<br />in <br /> our simulations<br />we find that in order to shield ser98 from unfavorable hydrophobic exposure , the thinning at tmh2 also <br /> constrains the lipids at the adjacent tmh1 ( see ref ( 30 ) for a discussion of this <br /> type of constraint ) , so that the membrane can not deform significantly <br /> and thus leaves the pro34 residue highly exposed ( see <br /> figure 5d and table 2 ) .<br />( a  c ) views of membrane deformation patterns around the <br /> rhodopsin immersed into 9.9 mag lamellar bilayers .<br />the average positioning <br /> of membrane leaflets is identified by the two surfaces colored according <br /> to the local thickness of the bilayer ( see the bar for color definition ) .<br />the gpcr is shown in van der waals representation with the tm helices <br /> colored as follows : tm1 in gray , tm2 in orange , tm3 in white , tm4 <br /> in pink , tm5 in purple , tm6 in black , and tm7 in lime the rest of <br /> the protein ( loops , etc . )<br />( d ) magnified view of the <br /> region containing residues pro34 and ser98 ( both rendered in green ) showing the membrane deformations in their <br /> vicinity .<br />figure 5 shows that the <br /> 9.9 mag planar bilayer <br /> deforms around other tm helices as well .<br />specifically , the membrane <br /> thins around tmh4 , alleviating the residual mismatch for this helix , <br /> and around tmh7 where the deformation efficiently accommodates the <br /> juxtaposed amphipathic helix 8 at the hydrophobic / hydrophilic interface .<br />overall , the heterogeneous pattern of membrane deformations we observe <br /> around rhodopsin in the current simulations agrees with earlier findings <br /> from all - atom md simulations showing the pattern of membrane remodeling <br /> around rhodopsin and the homologous serotonin 5-ht2a gpcr .<br />consistent with those studies , <br /> we find here that the deformations of the lamellar 9.9 mag bilayer <br /> do not completely alleviate the hydrophobic mismatch with the receptor <br /> ( table 2 ) .<br />the different organization of the <br /> two lipid phases around the gpcr , as presented below , explains why <br /> the residual exposure was larger for rhodopsin in the lamellar 9.9 <br /> mag bilayer than in the 9.9 mag lcp .<br />figure 6 shows the <br /> organization of the lipid cubic phase around rhodopsin in the initial <br /> configuration where the protein was randomly inserted in the lcp ( see <br /> also figure s1 in the supporting information ) , compared to the organization after 4.8 s of cg md simulations .<br />c with d  f in figure 6 shows the substantial rearrangement of the lipids and solvent <br /> around rhodopsin during the long md trajectory .<br />specifically , it appears <br /> that the lcp tends to minimize hydrophobic / hydrophilic contacts with <br /> the gpcr as the water and lipid headgroup beads organize around polar <br /> regions of the protein ( yellow colors in figure 6 ) , whereas the lipid hydrocarbon chain beads surround the hydrophobic <br /> core of the protein ( see caption of figure 6 for tm definitions ) .<br />snapshots illustrating initial ( a  c ) , and final <br /> ( after 4.8 <br /> s simulations ) positioning ( d  f ) of rhodopsin ( in yellow / white )<br />inside the cubic phase .<br />a and d show the organization of water beads<br />( in cyan ) , b and e illustrate the organization of 9.9 mag lipid headgroup<br />beads ( in pink ) , and c and f show the organization of 9.9 mag lipid <br /> hydrophobic core beads ( in purple ) .<br />in all panels<br />rhodopsin transmembrane <br /> ( tm ) helices are colored in white and the rest of the protein in yellow .<br />shown are only water and 9.9 mag lipids that are within 20  <br /> of rhodopsin ; rhodopsin is oriented so that its intracellular and <br /> extracellular ends ( as defined in the lipid bilayer ) point toward <br /> the bottom and top of the panels , respectively .<br />the snapshots in figure 6 also show that <br /> rhodopsin equilibrates , as expected , around the saddle - point inside <br /> the lcp so that the tm bundle perpendicularly <br /> traverses a narrow but relatively flattened region of the lcp bilayer , <br /> much like the gpcr protein does in the lamellar bilayers .<br />however , <br /> due to continuous and intrinsically saddle - shaped geometry of the <br /> diamond cubic phase , the lcp bilayer is dramatically curved near tmh1 <br /> and tmh5 , which effectively confines the protein to a small region <br /> of the lcp .<br />this special arrangement of the cubic mesophase around <br /> rhodopsin shields the gpcr in the lcp from the kind of unfavorable <br /> hydrophobic / hydrophilic interactions with the lipid bilayer seen in <br /> the lamellar membranes .<br />thus , as illustrated in figure s4 ( in the supporting information ) and reflected in the <br /> residual energy penalties ( in table 2 ) , residues <br /> pro34 and phe228 are in contact with <br /> the hydrophobic core of the lcp bilayer and therefore do not incur <br /> a residual mismatch penalty , although gln36 experiences <br /> somewhat higher residual exposure in the lcp compared to the lamellar <br /> phase ( see figure s4 and table 2 ) .<br />glamellar to be 2.7 kbt for the pro34/gln36 pair , and 1.8 kbt for phe228 ( table 2 ) .<br />notably , the shielding of ser98 that faced the 9.9 mag lipid bilayer in the lamellar phase <br /> simulations , occurs in the lcp simulations through interaction with <br /> the protein backbone .<br />to relate the calculated residual mismatch <br /> energies to the organization <br /> of the lipidic cubic mesophase around the gpcr , we quantitatively <br /><br />compared the structural arrangement of the lcp bilayer near the protein , <br /> to that in the bulk cubic phase .<br />as described in methods ,<br />two different approaches were used : in the first , <br /> we obtained an analytical fit of the lipid bilayer midplane shape <br /> around the protein by fitting the coordinates of 9.9 mag lipid c5a <br /> methyl terminus beads ( figure 1a ) from the <br /> simulations to f(x , y , z ,  ) =<br />ci , considering <br /> { ci } coefficients as <br /> variable parameters that must be minimized during the fitting ( see methods ) .<br />the application of this procedure to spherical <br /> lipid shells situated at different distances from rhodopsin ( see figure 7a ) revealed that the organization of the lcp close <br /> to the gpcr is different from that expected for the pn3 m lipid bilayer ( ci  0 in figure 7a ) .<br />however , <br /> already at distances 50  from the center of rhodopsin <br /> ( compare to 3540  linear dimension of a rhodopsin - like <br /> gpcr in bilayer x  y plane directions ) , the <br /> simulated structure relaxes to the organization of the diamond cubic <br /> phase ( ci <br /> = 0 , figure 7a ) .<br />the second approach confirms <br /> that the distorted lcp bilayer near the protein tends to relax toward <br /> the pn3 m phase arrangement at larger distances ( figure 7b ) .<br />in this alternative approach<br />we locally quantify <br /> the shape of the lipid bilayer around the gpcr by aligning trajectory <br /> frames from the simulation of rhodopsin in lcp onto snapshots from <br /> the simulations of the pure lcp system , so as to optimize the overlap <br /> of the water - containing and water - free regions ( see methods ) .<br />a scoring function defined locally ( see eq 5 ) is used to assess the quality of the alignment .<br />as seen from figure 7b , this procedure revealed <br /> that the fit between the densities of c5a lipid beads in protein - containing <br /> and protein - free systems progressively improves with the radial distance <br /> from the gpcr ( increasing s in figure 7b ) .<br />indeed , consistent with the result in figure 7a , the scoring function reaches its plateau 50  <br /> away from the protein , indicating that at these distances the lcp <br /> arrangement becomes similar to that expected for the pn3 m phase .<br />distance dependence of the relaxation of membrane deformation near <br /> rhodopsin in the cubic phase .<br />( a ) analytical fit of the density of <br /> c5a 9.9 mag lipid beads from cg md simulation of rhodopsin in the <br /> lcp phase to the surface defined by the f(x , y , z ,  ) =<br />ci equation ( see methods ) .<br />the mean values <br /> of the { ci } fitting coefficient <br /> distribution as a function of r , are shown for 10 <br />  spherical lipid shells located at r = 20 , 30 , 40 , and 50  away the protein center - of - mass .<br />( b ) reasults from the same measurements performed with an alternative <br /> approach based on the alignment of the lipid bilayer midplane in protein - containing <br /> and protein - free cubic phases ( see methods ) .<br />the quality of the fit upon alignment was determined for 10  <br /> spherical lipid shells located at distances r from <br /> the protein center - of - mass , and the panel shows the dependence of <br /> the scoring function s on r. note <br /> that the deformed cubic phase near rhodopsin relaxes to the arrangement <br /> that is characteristic of the pn3 m phase 50 <br />  away from the protein .<br />taken together , our results establish a quantitative <br /> link between <br /> the residual mismatch penalty and the lipid bilayer deformations around <br /> the gpcr in the cubic phase .<br />thus , the areas where the largest perturbations <br /> from the diamond cubic phase were observed included residues pro34 and phe228 ( see figure s5 in the supporting material ) , which are also the residues <br /> with the largest value of glcp  <br /> glamellar ( table 2 ) .<br />the main findings from this study offer <br /> unprecedented insight into <br /> molecular level processes related to in meso crystallization , <br /> which are likely leading to protein nucleation and eventually to crystal <br /> growth .<br />thus , we found that the difference in the hydrophobic / hydrophilic <br /> exposure of the protein to the lipid bilayers of 9.9 mag lcp and lamellar <br /> phases is responsible for a lower residual mismatch ( and its corresponding <br /> energy penalty ) in the cubic mesophase compared to the lamellar membranes .<br />this indicates why gpcrs reconstituted into the lcp in the initial <br /> stages of the in meso trial are well accommodated <br /> inside the cubic phase , where they are believed to reside mostly in <br /> the monomeric form .<br />indeed , from our findings there is insignificant <br /> drive toward rhodopsin oligomerization in the lcp .<br />we showed , however , <br /> why this drive is increased in the planar bilayer environment of the <br /> lamellar phase where there are several critical mechanistic factors <br /> that determine the probability for proteins to oligomerize .<br />one important <br /> energy component that has been established from both experiments and computations , involves the hydrophobic mismatch .<br />in particular , a plausible mechanism to relieve the energy penalty <br /> due to residual exposure is protein oligomerization , whereby the tm <br /> segments incurring the highest energy penalty from the residual exposure <br /> come together in the lipid bilayer .<br />for <br /> such hydrophobic - mismatch driven association to occur<br />, the <br /> residual exposure penalty alleviated by the protein association must <br /> counteract other critical factors that could favor proteins in the <br /> monomeric state .<br />one such important consideration is the mobility <br /> of proteins , because constrained diffusion reduces the chance for <br /> protein  protein encounter .<br />as shown in figure 8 , the spatial restriction encountered by the gpcr inside the <br /> lcp<br />( see figure 6 ) significantly affects protein <br /> mobility , with the diffusion coefficient of the gpcr in the cubic <br /> phase being smaller ( dlcp = 1.1  <br /> 10 m / sec ) than that in the lamellar <br /> bilayers ( dlamellar = 5.5  10 m / sec ) .<br />the restricted diffusion mode <br /> for rhodopsin in the lcp environment is consistent with the suggested <br /> high energy cost in the lcp for gpcr - sized proteins to cross between <br /> different regions of the mesophase .<br />this <br /> energy penalty was quantified from phenomenological principles to <br /> be as high as 1220 kbt in the pn3 m phase with lattice parameter values in the 75110  <br /> range .<br />this estimated energy cost of protein <br /> diffusion in the lcp is significantly higher than the residual mismatch <br /> penalty we calculated for rhodopsin in the cubic phase ( table 2 ) .<br />when considered together , the relatively low <br /> residual exposure energy for the gpcr in the lcp is not likely to <br /> be sufficient to compensate for the high energy barrier for protein <br /> mobility in the lcp and drive protein association .<br />the prediction <br /> is , therefore , that in the cubic mesophase gpcr proteins will remain <br /> largely in the monomeric state .<br />mean - square - displacement ( msd ) as a function of <br /> time calculated for rhodopsin in the 9.9 mag lipidic cubic phase ( lcp ) <br /> and in the 9.9 mag lamellar membrane ( lamellar ) .<br />corresponding diffusion <br /> coefficient values , calculated from the linear fit performed in [ 0 <br /> s;1 s ] time interval , are dlcp =<br />1.1  10 m / sec and dlamellar =<br />5.5  10 m / sec .<br />in contrast to the lcp , the lamellar membrane environment <br /> is more <br /> favorable for gpcr oligomerization : the residual energy penalty for <br /> the rhodopsin tm bundle in the lamellar bilayers is 8 kbt ( table 2 ) and is significantly higher compared to that in the lcp , <br /> indicating a stronger drive for gpcr oligomerization in the lamellar <br /> membranes .<br />a higher propensity for association in the planar bilayers <br /> is also supported by our calculations of the protein mobility in the <br /> two lipid environments , whereby we find a 5-fold larger diffusion <br /> coefficient for the gpcr in the lamellar bilayers ( figure 8) .<br />taken together , results from our simulations <br /> suggest that planar <br /> 9.9 mag lipid membranes provide a more suitable setting for oligomerization <br /> of the gpcr proteins .<br />notably , this prediction is based on results <br /> for oligomerization in a plane of the lipid bilayer .<br />this 2d nucleation <br /> process together with the formation of protein - enriched lamellar stacks <br /> in 3d should ultimately drive the emergence <br /> of a bulk crystal .<br />the question remains regarding the mechanism <br /> that drives the proteins <br /> from the lcp to the lamellar membranes and the potential role of the <br /> differential residual interactions between the protein and the bilayers <br /> of the two lipidic phases in the nucleation process .<br />we note that <br /> the nucleation is triggered by the addition of the precipitant which <br /> is known to cause transient water depletion from the lcp interior , resulting in structural changes in the cubic <br /> phase bilayer .<br />our current study has not attempted to quantify the <br /> effects of the precipitant , but it is reasonable to speculate that <br /> dehydration of the cubic phase will only increase the unfavorable <br /> residual interactions between the gpcr and the lcp bilayer .<br />this is likely to increase the drive for protein <br /> oligomerization inside the lcp upon precipitant addition , which could <br /> lead to the formation of locally flattened lamellar bilayers as a <br /> prelude to protein crystallization .<br />in order to address quantitatively <br /> the structural perturbations due to precipitant , such as changes in <br /> curvature of the lcp bilayer ,<br />it is critical to calculate the corresponding <br /> deformation energies in the presence of the protein .<br />however , the <br /> representation of the complex geometry of the lcp around the insertion <br /> ( figures 67 )<br />in the numerical approach developed in the current work for quantifying <br /> the lcp shape ( i.e. , fitting the md data to the analytical solution )<br />is not sufficiently refined to serve in the calculation of reliable <br /> energies<br />we note , however , that recent experimental studies showed that , compared to 9.9 <br /> mag , in meso trials conducted on the gpcr - gs protein <br /> complex with a shorter chain mag analog , 7.7 mag ( acyl chain 14 carbon <br /> atoms long with the cis double bond between carbon atoms 7 and 8) <br /> resulted in better quality crystals .<br />thus , results from our <br /> current studies as well as from recently reported all - atom simulations <br /> of gpcrs in membranes of different thicknesses , explain why 7.7 mag would provide a better platform in <br /> which gpcrs can aggregate more extensively : based on our findings <br /> we can predict that , due to the expected 78  <br /> difference in the hydrophobic thickness of planar 9.9 mag and 7.7 <br /> mag membranes , the residual exposure of the gpcr will be substantially <br /> higher in the thinner 7.7 mag lamellar bilayers . as an example<br />, we <br /> recently reported that the rhodopsin tm bundle will exhibit a 12 kbt higher residual energy penalty <br /> in dic14:1pc than in dic18:1pc bilayers .<br />a more complete quantitative elucidation of <br /> the gpcr nucleation process in relation to the residual mismatch energy <br /> component requires further studies that would take into consideration <br /> the effect of the different precipitants on various lipids .<br />the structurally specific predictions of the regions where the <br /> residual mismatch with lipid bilayers of cubic and lamellar phases <br /> differed for the rhodopsin tm bundle made it possible to probe the <br /> resulting predictions and general character of the findings by examining <br /> crystallographic data .<br />in particular , we showed here that the intracellular <br /> ( ic ) end of tmh1 ( pro34 ) , and<br />the extracellular ( ec ) <br /> part of the tmh5 including phe228 have higher residual <br /> exposure in lamellar membranes , which leads to the prediction ( e.g. , <br /> see shan et al . )<br />that in the planar bilayers <br /> rhodopsin will exhibit strong hydrophobic - mismatch driven tendency <br /> for oligomerization through tmh1 and tmh5 . to assess this hypothesis <br /> in the context of structural information available for gpcrs , we examined <br /> crystallographic contact interfaces for 12 different structures of <br /> rhodopsin - like gpcrs obtained by means of the in meso technology ( 2 receptor  pbd codes : 2rh1 , 3pds , 3sn6 ; a2a receptor  <br /> pdb codes : 3eml , 3qak ; chemokine <br /> cxcr4 receptor  pdb codes : 3odu , 3oe0 , 3oe6 , 3oe8 , 3oe9 ; dopamine d3 receptor <br />  pdb code : 3pbl , and histamine h1 receptor  pdb code : 3rze ) .<br />for all these <br /> gpcr structures , we analyzed the content of the unit crystallographic <br /> cell and quantified for each tm helix ( 1 ) the frequency of its occurrence <br /> at the crystallographic contact interface and ( 2 ) the number of residue <br /> interactions each tm helix forms at the contact interface .<br />canonical  interfaces were considered , <br /> where the crystallographic contacts were formed exclusively through <br /> tm  tm interactions between monomers in parallel orientations .<br />remarkably , we found that tmh1 and tmh5 , the two helices implicated <br /> in the largest residual mismatch in our simulations of rhodopsin with <br /> 9.9 mag lamellar bilayers , contribute to the most common contact interfaces <br /> in the crystallographic structures of the homologous gpcrs .<br />more specifically , <br /> as illustrated in figure s6a ( see supporting information ) , all but 4 of the 14 distinct intermolecular tm <br />tm interfaces <br /> identified in this analysis , involve tmh1 and/or tmh5 . furthermore , <br /> examining the residues involved in the interactions at the contact <br /> interfaces revealed that the tmh1 stretch of residues in positions <br /> 1.291.34 ( that would include pro34 in the homologous <br /> rhodopsin gpcr ) contribute significantly to the formation of the crystallographic <br /> interface .<br />during the final preparation of this manuscript , <br /> two new crystal <br /> structures of rhodopsin - like gpcrs ,<br />the -opioid receptor ( kor ) <br /> and the -opioid receptor ( mor ) were reported to be obtained <br /> by means of in meso crystallization .<br />consistent with the data presented above , the crystallographic interface <br /> of kor consists of tm1 , tm2 and h8 , with the n - terminal end of tm1 <br /> ( region harboring the residue homologous to pro34 in <br /> rhodopsin ) forming extensive dimeric contacts .<br />for mor , two crystallographic <br /> interfaces were reported : the more prominent interface consisted of<br />tm5/tm6 helices with the i256 residue ( aligning with <br /> the residue next to phe228 in rhodopsin ) residing at <br /> the dimer interface , and more limited contacts formed by tm1 , tm2 <br /> and h8 . taken together ,<br />our findings support the mechanistic <br /> inferences <br /> that ( 1 ) the reduced level of hydrophobic mismatch in the lcp is attributable <br /> to the specific highly curved geometry of the cubic phase that provides <br /> for more coverage from unfavorable hydrophobic exposure ; ( 2 ) compared <br /> to the lcp , lamellar structures provide a more favorable setting in <br /> which gpcrs can oligomerize as a prelude to nucleation and crystal <br /> growth ; and ( 3 ) the extent of the residual mismatch penalty is likely <br /> one of the critical mechanistic factors that determines not only the <br /> drive for gpcr proteins to oligomerize during in meso crystallization , but also the structural elements that are likely <br /> to participate in contact interfaces .<br />these findings provide <br /> novel energy - based insights into in meso crystallization <br /> mechanisms and lay a foundation <br /> for future computational explorations involving other class - a gpcrs <br /> toward designing rational approaches for generation of structure - quality <br /> crystals of membrane proteins .", "summary": "<pad> the lipidic cubic phases are a suitable medium for grow high quality crystals of proteins. the lipidic cubic phases are a highly curved bilayer structure that is continuous in 3d and separates in space three nonintersecting aqueous channels in the lipidic cubic phases. in meso trials, the protein is reconstituted into the cubic phase, and it is proposed that the protein is reconstituted into the cubic phase, and that it is preferentially partitioned into lamellar phases that appears within the cubic phase. in meso trials, the protein is reconstituted into the cubic phase, and it is proposed that the protein is reconstituted into the cubic phase as a prelude of nucleation or crystal growth. in meso trials, the protein is reconstituted into the cubic phase, and it is proposed that the protein is reconstituted into the cubic phase as a prelude of nucleation or crystal growth. in meso trials, the protein is reconstituted into the cubic phase, and it is proposed that the protein is reconstituted into the cubic phase as a prelude of nucleation or crystal growth. in meso trials, the protein is reconstituted into the cubic phase, and it is proposed that the protein is reconstituted into the cubic phase as a prelude of nucleation or crystal growth. in meso trials, the protein is reconstituted into the cubic phase, and it is proposed that the protein is reconstituted into the cubic phase as a prelude of nucleation or crystal growth. in meso trials, the protein is reconstituted into the cubic phase, and it is proposed that the protein is reconstituted into the cubic phase as a prelude of nucleation or crystal growth. in meso trials, the protein is reconstituted into the cubic phase, and it is proposed that the protein is reconstituted into the cubic phase as a prelude of nucleation or crystal growth. in meso trials, the protein is reconstituted into the cubic phase, and it is proposed that the protein is reconstituted into the cubic phase. in meso trials, the protein is reconstituted"}, "article_1_bigbird_pegasus": {"source_doc": "activation of mast cell degranulation has been demonstrated to be an important mediator of allergic disease and more recently , as an initiator or contributor to autoimmune disease [ 1 - 4 ] .<br />mast cells are granulocytes that emanate from myeloid progenitors in bone marrow and play a critical role in innate immunity as vital sentinel cells that combat invading microorganisms at tissue / environment interfaces [ 1 - 4 ] .<br />mast cells are phagocytic and can directly destroy pathogens ; they also release inflammatory mediators which promote inflammation by recruiting and activating other leukocytes .<br />as regulators of adaptive immunity , mast cells promote antigen presentation , naive t cell differentiation into helper t cells , and induction of acquired immunity towards parasites via ige / fcr binding [ 1 - 4 ] .<br />the major contribution of mast cells to both immune function and dysfunction results from the release of a plethora of inflammatory mediators through a process known as regulated exocytosis [ 1 - 5 ] .<br />this process occurs in many cell types and involves the storage of intracellular pools of inflammatory mediators , hormones or neurotransmitters in pre - formed granules / vesicles . upon activation of the cell ,<br />fusion can be activated through receptor stimulation or by membrane depolarization via 2 messengers , for example ca .<br />the transport , fusion and release of vesicle contents through exocytosis is mediated by a family of proteins known as the snares [ 7 - 11 ] .<br />soluble n - ethylmaleimide - sensitive factor attachment protein receptors have been demonstrated to play a pivotal role in regulated exocytosis ( degranulation ) in mast cells [ 12 - 22 ] and represent a mechanical step involved in inflammatory mediators release that can be targeted for the design and development of therapeutics .<br />we review the expression , localization and operation of various functional snare complexes in both murine and human mast cells .<br />we evaluate the published functional data that has been used to implicate specific snares and snare complexes as indispensable mediators of mast cell degranulation .<br />vesicular trafficking of essential molecules between cellular compartments and into and out of cells is required for cell function and survival .<br />in neurons ,<br />neurotransmitter release is widely acknowledged as critical for the development and function of the nervous system in all higher organisms .<br />the snare family of proteins mediates the highly regulated processes of vesicular assembly and disassembly [ 6 , 810 ] .<br />numerous proteins are involved in the formation and disassembly of active snare complexes during membrane fusion .<br />each set of snare proteins act as a vesicle loading signal , a mechanical address ( delivering the vesicle to the correct target membrane ) , and in the mechanical process of fusing two opposing membranes .<br />the neuronal and immunological snare proteins have a another layer of complexity added to this paradigm , the vesicles are loaded with cargo , but dock and await a chemical fusion signal .<br />the snare family of evolutionarily conserved proteins was first identified in the 1980s in yeast and a decade later in mammalian cells .<br />snares are found in most eukaryotic cells ; 25 members have been identified in saccharomyces cerevisiae , 54 members in arabidopsis thaliana and > 36 members in humans .<br />the proteins are composed of a simple domain structure highlighted by a snare motif , a stretch of 6070 amino acids arranged in a heptad repeat [ 6 - 11 ] .<br />core complexes form stable structures , which are composed of four intertwined parallel -helices contributed by three to four different snare members [ 6 - 11 ] .<br />these complexes consist of a central core of three glutamine residues and one arginine residue bordered by hydrophobic stacked layers of side chains .<br />soluble n - ethylmaleimide sensitive factor attachment protein receptors can be classified on the basis of whether they contain a q or r residue in their motif and are referred to as either a qa , qb , qc , qbc , or r - snares based on the position of their contributing motif in the assembled snare complex .<br />the vesicle - associated membrane protein ( vamp ) family of snares are examples of the r - snare sub - type and are characterized by a single transmembrane domain , a snare motif and a n - terminal domain containing profilin - like folds [ 8 , 10 ] .<br />the syntaxin family of snares is an example of the qa or qc sub - type and are characterized by a single transmembrane domain , a snare motif and a n - terminal domain made up of anti - parallel three - helix bundles [ 8 , 10 ] .<br />the synaptosome - associated protein ( snap ) family of snares is an example of the qbc subtype and contain two snare motifs joined by a flexible linker and that is palmitoylated and therefore lacks a transmembrane domain [ 8 , 10 ] .<br />the snap family is unique in that they contribute two snare motifs to the snare complex .<br />soluble n - ethylmaleimide - sensitive factor attachment protein receptors were previously classified based on whether they localized to the vesicle membrane ( v - snares ; e.g. vamps ) or to the target plasma membrane ( t - snares ; e.g. syntaxins and the snap families ) but these classifications have subsequently been shown to have a number of exceptions .<br />soluble n - ethylmaleimide - sensitive factor attachment protein receptors localized on opposing membranes [ vesicle : vesicle or vesicle : plasma membrane ] drive fusion of membranes using the free energy released during the formation of the stable four - helix bundle .<br />post - fusion snare proteins end up on the interior surface of the target membrane .<br />these bundles are recycled via dissociation mediated by n - ethylmaleimide - sensitive factor ( nsf ) and other co - factors such as snap ( soluble nsf attachment protein ) .<br />mechanical models [ 6 - 11 ] all predict that snares function to bring opposing membranes into close proximity initiating fusion events .<br />the presence of ca is indispensable , acting to bridge the opposing membranes , which leads to the exclusion of water allowing lipid mixing , fusion and subsequent exocytosis .<br />ca - regulated snare complexes are involved in neurotransmitter release [ 8 , 23 ] .<br />the neuronal snare complex was the first snare complex identified and the most vigorously dissected .<br />docked vesicles containing snare complexes composed of syntaxin 1a and snap-25 on the plasma membrane and vamp-2 on the vesicular membrane allow for the rapid ( millisecond ) release of neurotransmitters upon ca influx .<br />free , uncomplexed membrane snares form cis - snare acceptor complexes on the plasma membrane in response to the actions of regulatory proteins .<br />these acceptor complexes on the plasma membranes interact with snares on opposing vesicular membranes and form trans - snare complexes that are fusion <br />ready.<br />these  docked vesicles persist for a substantial period of time until ca influx triggers the final step of fusion and cargo ( neurotransmitter ) release through the actions of ca sensors such as synaptotagmin and complexins .<br />various investigators have reported the expression of multiple snares in murine and human mast cells [ 12 , 13 , 15 , 17 , 1922 , 2431 ] .<br />composite rt - pcr data identifying snare mrna in murine and human mast cells are presented in table 1 .<br />the neuronal snare snap-25 showed weak mrna expression in human mast cells , but was not detected via western blot in the same study .<br />multiple studies report the expression of several vamp family representatives mrna [ vamp-1 , 2 , 3 , 7 , 8 ( r snares ) ] and several members of the syntaxin family [ syntaxin 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ( qa snares ) ] as well .<br />snare family mrna expression in murine and human mast cells immunoblotting studies confirm that snap-23 is the consensus representative of the qb , c family in both murine and human mast cells ( see composite of protein expression data presented in table 2 ) .<br />interestingly , two groups have reported the expression of the neuronal snap-25 qb , c snare protein in primary murine mast cells via immunoblot and immunohistochemistry [ 25 , 27 ] .<br />these data could not be recapitulated in published work by several groups in primary murine mast cells [ 12 , 22 ] and the rat cell line rbl-2h3 [ 13 , 22 , 24 ] .<br />the reason[s ] behind this discrepancy is not clear , but may involve specificity of antibodies and/or limits of detection of signal .<br />protein expression of vamp and syntaxin family members correlate well with mrna studies , as the majority of snares detected via rt - pcr were also detected via immunoblot .<br />snare family protein expression ( via immunoblotting ) in murine and human mast cells immunohistochemistry studies in primary murine mast cells [ 12 , 18 , 21 ] have demonstrated that snap-23 and syntaxin 4 localize to the plasma membrane , while syntaxin 3 , vamp-2 and vamp-8 appear to localize to secretory granules .<br />detected snap-25 expression in the secretory granules of rat primary mast cells ( rpmc ) .<br />similar immunohistochemistry results in rbl-2h3 cells [ 13 , 14 , 24 , 29 , 31 ] have been reported demonstrating plasma membrane localization of snap-23 , syntaxin 4<br />and syntaxin 3 ; and secretory granule localization of syntaxin 3 , vamp-2 , 3 , 7 and 8 . in human mast cells ,<br />sander et al .<br />demonstrated that snap-23 and syntaxin 4 localize in the plasma membrane while vamp-3 , vamp-7 and vamp-8 are dispersed throughout the cytoplasm , suggesting granule localization .<br />however , upon activation of the mast cell , only vamp-7 and vamp-8 appear to redistribute to the periphery of the cell , suggesting fusion and degranulation .<br />immunoprecipitation ( ip ) pull - down studies in primary murine mast cells , rbl-2h3 cells , and human mast cells have identified snare complexes composed of snap-23 and syntaxin 4 in complex with the r - snares , vamp-2 [ 13 , 18 , 28 , 29 ] , vamp-8 [ 13 , 15 , 17 , 18 , 22 ] ; vamp-7   and vamp-3 .<br />in addition , complexes composed of snap-23 , syntaxin 3 and vamp-8 also co - precipitated .<br />.<br />demonstrated that ip with anti - snap-23 antibody in rbl-2h3 cells pulled down syntaxin 2 , 3 , 4 and vamp-2 , 3 , 8 .<br />interestingly , n - ethylmaleimide ( nem ) treatment was required to observe vamp-8 co - precipitation .<br />it was also demonstrated that ip with anti - syntaxin 4 resulted in the co - precipitation of snap-23 , vamp-2 , vamp-3 and vamp-8 , while ip with anti - syntaxin 2 or syntaxin 3 only pulled down snap-23 .<br />these data suggest that ternary complexes in rbl-2h3 cells consist of snap-23 , syntaxin 4 and a member of the r - snares family , presumably vamp-2 , 3 or 8 .<br />showed that in rbl-2h3 cell lysates ; syntaxin 4 co - precipitated with snap-23 and vamp-8 within and outside of lipid rafts ; however , syntaxin 3 , snap-23 and vamp-8 co - precipitates were found to be complexed only within lipid rafts .<br />the implication of these two different complexes and their unequal distribution in the membrane remains unclear .<br />additional studies by hepp et al .<br />demonstrated co - precipitated complexes of snap-23 , vamp-2 and syntaxin 4 in rbl-2h3 cells and also showed that most of the snap-23 associated with vamp-2 and syntaxin 4 in these complexes is phosphorylated .<br />an elegant study by puri et al .<br />demonstrated that snap-23 , syntaxin 4 , vamp-2 complexes are present in lipid rafts and showed that snap-23 functions to recruit non - lipid raft - associated syntaxin 4 into a functional complex .<br />once again it was demonstrated that a predominant proportion of the snap-23 in complexes was phosphorylated , implicating snap-23 phosphorylation as a key prerequisite to complex formation .<br />our group has demonstrated that in rbl-2h3 cells , snap-23 co - precipitates with syntaxin 4 and vamp-8 ; however , nem treatment was needed to observe vamp-8 association .<br />in human mast cells isolated from surgical tissues , sander et al<br />.<br />demonstrated that snap-23 co - precipitated with syntaxin 4 , vamp-7 and vamp-8 , but not vamp-2 and vamp-3 .<br />in<br />derived mast cells , vamp-8 was shown to associate preferentially with syntaxin 4 and snap-23 , and to a lesser degree , vamp-2 .<br />however , it appears that vamp-2 and vamp-3   may act to substitute for vamp-8 in vamp-8-deficient cells , perhaps due to an unusual compensatory mechanism .<br />isolation of ternary complexes of snare proteins after cellular activation has proven anything but trivial .<br />previous data have demonstrated that only 5% of the snap-23 present in rbl-2h3 cells is actually capable of forming a complex after activation .<br />furthermore , it is suggested that snare complexes have limited lifespans after activation - induced formation [ 35 , 36 ] .<br />using recombinant snare proteins , foster et al .<br />demonstrated the in vitro association of the recombinant snares , snap-23 , vamp-2 and syntaxin 4 and further demonstrated that deletion of the amino terminus and the second coiled - coil domain of snap-23 inhibited binding to both vamp-2 and syntaxin 4 .<br />although immunolocalization and ip studies identify the individual snare proteins and their complexes associated with mast cell function , functional studies aimed at disrupting snare complex formation / action provide a practical method to dissect the role of these complexes in mast cell degranulation .<br />snare proteins also function to mediate constitutive trafficking events through both endocytic and secretory pathways ; reviewed in hong et al .<br />previously published functional data have implicated the snares snap-23 , syntaxin 4 , vamp-2 , vamp-3 , vamp-7 and vamp-8 in mast cell degranulation in studies using streptolysin - o - permeabilized cells and inhibitory recombinant snare proteins , snare neutralizing antibodies [ 12 , 17 , 19 ] ; overexpression studies [ 13 , 14 , 22 , 29 , 38 ] , rna interference methods [ 20 , 22 , 39 ] and snare - deficient mice [ 18 , 21 ] .<br />a compilation of functional data implicating the various snare proteins is presented in table 3 .<br />functional data implicating snare proteins in mast cell degranulation the most compelling evidence for the role of snare proteins in mast cell degranulation is presented in data describing vamp-8-deficient mice [ 18 , 21 ] .<br />.<br />demonstrated that mast cells derived from the bone marrow of these mice [ bmmc ] had a 50% decrease in their ability to release -hexosaminidase and serotonin but had normal histamine and tnf- release .<br />tiwari et al .<br />showed that bmmc from vamp-8-deficient mice resulted in a 50% decrease in -hexosaminidase and histamine , but no changes in cytokine / chemokine release .<br />our group has shown via sirna that we could demonstrate about a 50% knockdown in rbl-2h3 degranulation after targeting vamp-8 mrna / protein .<br />interestingly , puri et al .<br />also showed that vamp-2 and vamp-3 do not play a role in mast cell degranulation as bmmc derived from vamp-3-deficient animals and mast cells derived from vamp-2-deficient stem cells showed normal degranulation .<br />these data are confirmed by studies with tetanus toxins [ 17 , 40 ] , which are known to cleave and inactivate vamp-2 but do not have any effect on mast cell degranulation .<br />supporting evidence for the role of vamp-8 in mast cell degranulation comes from sander et al . , who demonstrated that neutralizing anti - vamp-8 antibodies inhibit degranulation in streptolysin - permeabilized human mast cells by 60% .<br />data from this report also demonstrated a role for vamp-7 ( 50% inhibition ) but not vamp-2 and vamp-3 .<br />similarly , lippert et al .<br />demonstrated that recombinant vamp-8 inhibited ca-/gtps - mediated degranulation in permeabilized rbl-2h3 cells by 30% .<br />our group 's sirna studies also implicate snap-23 and syntaxin 4 as essential for rbl-2h3 degranulation , as knockdown of these snares resulted in 30% inhibition of degranulation when compared to control sirna treatment .<br />in support of our data ,<br />salinas et al .<br />demonstrated that in permeabilized rpmc , neutralizing antibodies to snap-23 and syntaxin 4 resulted in 25% and 65% inhibition of histamine release .<br />in addition , sander et al .<br />demonstrated that neutralizing antibodies to snap-23 and syntaxin 4 inhibited histamine release from permeabilized human mast cells with inhibition reaching 90% and 40% , respectively .<br />earlier studies by guo et al .<br />demonstrated that anti - snap-23 neutralizing antibody decreased rpmc degranulation , although this inhibition required high antibody concentrations ( 500 g / ml ) .<br />recently , suzuki et al .<br />demonstrated that a shrna to snap-23 knocked down degranulation in stimulated rbl-2h3 cells by 30% , similar to the maximal inhibition we have observed for snap-23 .<br />in addition , liu et al .<br />demonstrated that treatment of rbl-2h3 cells with syntaxin 4 sirna resulted in a decrease in antigen - induced histamine and -hexosaminidase release .<br />interestingly , various groups [ 13 , 14 , 29 , 37 ] have implicated syntaxin 4 , vamp-7 and snap-23 in mast cell degranulation via overexpression studies .<br />overexpression of syntaxin 4 , vamp-7 and snap-23 all had an effect on degranulation in rbl-2h3 cells , although the effects were manifested as either an augmentation or inhibition of degranulation .<br />the exact mechanism leading to augmentation or inhibition has yet to be elucidated but may involve competition for free snare proteins or competition for regulatory proteins .<br />because many of the snare - deficient transgenic mice are embryonic lethal ( table 4 ) , sirna methods may represent the only efficient way to characterize degranulation pathways in both in vitro and in vivo models of anaphylaxis and autoimmune disease .<br />mast cell phenotype of snare knockout animals / cells these reports provide evidence that these snares do not participate in the mast cell degranulation process .<br />there are a number of studies published recently that utilize sirna to validate the role of individual snares or snare complexes mediating trafficking events in various cell types [ 46 - 54 ] .<br />however , an interesting report published recently   eloquently suggests that the abundance of snare - member isoforms and therefore the overall increase in snare redundancy may play a major role in the lack of snare sirna cellular efficacy .<br />in addition , the authors describe the phenomenon that many cell types appear to express a sizeable reserve of snare proteins not required for normal physiological cellular processes ( a so - called  snare reserve ) .<br />interestingly , the literature is scant with respect to sirna studies characterizing snare - protein function in mast cells .<br />in addition , as snares are intracellular targets , the use of biotherapeutics such as recombinant proteins or neutralizing antibodies is not possible as these large proteins can not as of yet be targeted to the inside of the cell .<br />therefore , interfering rna offers an exciting new approach for the development of a snare - directed therapy .<br />to date , several sirna - based therapies have initiated clinical trials for the treatment of viral diseases , cancer and macular degeneration .<br />in addition , our sirna data identifies snap-23 and syntaxin 4 as essential for rbl-2h3 degranulation , and knockdown of these snares resulted in 30% inhibition of degranulation when compared to control sirna treatment .<br />these studies reflect the effect that a snare sirna therapeutic could have as we utilized whole cells stimulated with physiologic stimuli .<br />however , additional studies focused on in vivo delivery of these sirna and testing in animal models of disease are warranted .<br />sec1/munc18 ( sm ) proteins are arch - shaped cytosolic proteins that have been demonstrated to bind syntaxins and regulate intracellular trafficking [ 57 , 58 ] .<br />specifically , munc182 has been demonstrated to play a role in mast cell degranulation [ 15 , 26 , 31 ] .<br />sm proteins appear to regulate snare activity in several ways [ 57 -

pcr data identifying snare mrna in murine and human mast cells are presented in table 1 .<br />the neuronal snare snap-25 showed weak mrna expression in human mast cells , but was not detected via western blot in the same study .<br />multiple studies report the expression of several vamp family representatives mrna [ vamp-1 , 2 , 3 , 7 , 8 ( r snares ) ] and several members of the syntaxin family [ syntaxin 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ( qa snares ) ] as well .<br />snare family mrna expression in murine and human mast cells immunoblotting studies confirm that snap-23 is the consensus representative of the qb , c family in both murine and human mast cells ( see composite of protein expression data presented in table 2 ) .<br />interestingly , two groups have reported the expression of the neuronal snap-25 qb , c snare protein in primary murine mast cells via immunoblot and immunohistochemistry [ 25 , 27 ] .<br />these data could not be recapitulated in published work by several groups in primary murine mast cells [ 12 , 22 ] and the rat cell line rbl-2h3 [ 13 , 22 , 24 ] .<br />the reason[s ] behind this discrepancy is not clear , but may involve specificity of antibodies and/or limits of detection of signal .<br />protein expression of vamp and syntaxin family members correlate well with mrna studies , as the majority of snares detected via rt - pcr were also detected via immunoblot .<br />snare family protein expression ( via immunoblotting ) in murine and human mast cells immunohistochemistry studies in primary murine mast cells [ 12 , 18 , 21 ] have demonstrated that snap-23 and syntaxin 4 localize to the plasma membrane , while syntaxin 3 , vamp-2 and vamp-8 appear to localize to secretory granules .<br />detected snap-25 expression in the secretory granules of rat primary mast cells ( rpmc ) .<br />similar immunohistochemistry results in rbl-2h3 cells [ 13 , 14 , 24 , 29 , 31 ] have been reported demonstrating plasma membrane localization of snap-23 , syntaxin 4<br />and syntaxin 3 ; and secretory granule localization of syntaxin 3 , vamp-2 , 3 , 7 and 8 . in human mast cells ,<br />sander et al .<br />demonstrated that snap-23 and syntaxin 4 localize in the plasma membrane while vamp-3 , vamp-7 and vamp-8 are dispersed throughout the cytoplasm , suggesting granule localization .<br />however , upon activation of the mast cell , only vamp-7 and vamp-8 appear to redistribute to the periphery of the cell , suggesting fusion and degranulation .<br />immunoprecipitation ( ip ) pull - down studies in primary murine mast cells , rbl-2h3 cells , and human mast cells have identified snare complexes composed of snap-23 and syntaxin 4 in complex with the r - snares , vamp-2 [ 13 , 18 , 28 , 29 ] , vamp-8 [ 13 , 15 , 17 , 18 , 22 ] ; vamp-7   and vamp-3 .<br />in addition , complexes composed of snap-23 , syntaxin 3 and vamp-8 also co - precipitated .<br />.<br />demonstrated that ip with anti - snap-23 antibody in rbl-2h3 cells pulled down syntaxin 2 , 3 , 4 and vamp-2 , 3 , 8 .<br />interestingly , n - ethylmaleimide ( nem ) treatment was required to observe vamp-8 co - precipitation .<br />it was also demonstrated that ip with anti - syntaxin 4 resulted in the co - precipitation of snap-23 , vamp-2 , vamp-3 and vamp-8 , while ip with anti - syntaxin 2 or syntaxin 3 only pulled down snap-23 .<br />these data suggest that ternary complexes in rbl-2h3 cells consist of snap-23 , syntaxin 4 and a member of the r - snares family , presumably vamp-2 , 3 or 8 .<br />showed that in rbl-2h3 cell lysates ; syntaxin 4 co - precipitated with snap-23 and vamp-8 within and outside of lipid rafts ; however , syntaxin 3 , snap-23 and vamp-8 co - precipitates were found to be complexed only within lipid rafts .<br />the implication of these two different complexes and their unequal distribution in the membrane remains unclear .<br />additional studies by hepp et al .<br />demonstrated co - precipitated complexes of snap-23 , vamp-2 and syntaxin 4 in rbl-2h3 cells and also showed that most of the snap-23 associated with vamp-2 and syntaxin 4 in these complexes is phosphorylated .<br />an elegant study by puri et al .<br />demonstrated that snap-23 , syntaxin 4 , vamp-2 complexes are present in lipid rafts and showed that snap-23 functions to recruit non - lipid raft - associated syntaxin 4 into a functional complex .<br />once again it was demonstrated that a predominant proportion of the snap-23 in complexes was phosphorylated , implicating snap-23 phosphorylation as a key prerequisite to complex formation .<br />our group has demonstrated that in rbl-2h3 cells , snap-23 co - precipitates with syntaxin 4 and vamp-8 ; however , nem treatment was needed to observe vamp-8 association .<br />in human mast cells isolated from surgical tissues , sander et al<br />.<br />demonstrated that snap-23 co - precipitated with syntaxin 4 , vamp-7 and vamp-8 , but not vamp-2 and vamp-3 .<br />in<br />derived mast cells , vamp-8 was shown to associate preferentially with syntaxin 4 and snap-23 , and to a lesser degree , vamp-2 .<br />however , it appears that vamp-2 and vamp-3   may act to substitute for vamp-8 in vamp-8-deficient cells , perhaps due to an unusual compensatory mechanism .<br />isolation of ternary complexes of snare proteins after cellular activation has proven anything but trivial .<br />previous data have demonstrated that only 5% of the snap-23 present in rbl-2h3 cells is actually capable of forming a complex after activation .<br />furthermore , it is suggested that snare complexes have limited lifespans after activation - induced formation [ 35 , 36 ] .<br />using recombinant snare proteins , foster et al .<br />demonstrated the in vitro association of the recombinant snares , snap-23 , vamp-2 and syntaxin 4 and further demonstrated that deletion of the amino terminus and the second coiled - coil domain of snap-23 inhibited binding to both vamp-2 and syntaxin 4 .<br />although immunolocalization and ip studies identify the individual snare proteins and their complexes associated with mast cell function , functional studies aimed at disrupting snare complex formation / action provide a practical method to dissect the role of these complexes in mast cell degranulation .<br />snare proteins also function to mediate constitutive trafficking events through both endocytic and secretory pathways ; reviewed in hong et al .<br />previously published functional data have implicated the snares snap-23 , syntaxin 4 , vamp-2 , vamp-3 , vamp-7 and vamp-8 in mast cell degranulation in studies using streptolysin - o - permeabilized cells and inhibitory recombinant snare proteins , snare neutralizing antibodies [ 12 , 17 , 19 ] ; overexpression studies [ 13 , 14 , 22 , 29 , 38 ] , rna interference methods [ 20 , 22 , 39 ] and snare - deficient mice [ 18 , 21 ] .<br />a compilation of functional data implicating the various snare proteins is presented in table 3 .<br />functional data implicating snare proteins in mast cell degranulation the most compelling evidence for the role of snare proteins in mast cell degranulation is presented in data describing vamp-8-deficient mice [ 18 , 21 ] .<br />.<br />demonstrated that mast cells derived from the bone marrow of these mice [ bmmc ] had a 50% decrease in their ability to release -hexosaminidase and serotonin but had normal histamine and tnf- release .<br />tiwari et al .<br />showed that bmmc from vamp-8-deficient mice resulted in a 50% decrease in -hexosaminidase and histamine , but no changes in cytokine / chemokine release .<br />our group has shown via sirna that we could demonstrate about a 50% knockdown in rbl-2h3 degranulation after targeting vamp-8 mrna / protein .<br />interestingly , puri et al .<br />also showed that vamp-2 and vamp-3 do not play a role in mast cell degranulation as bmmc derived from vamp-3-deficient animals and mast cells derived from vamp-2-deficient stem cells showed normal degranulation .<br />these data are confirmed by studies with tetanus toxins [ 17 , 40 ] , which are known to cleave and inactivate vamp-2 but do not have any effect on mast cell degranulation .<br />supporting evidence for the role of vamp-8 in mast cell degranulation comes from sander et al . , who demonstrated that neutralizing anti - vamp-8 antibodies inhibit degranulation in streptolysin - permeabilized human mast cells by 60% .<br />data from this report also demonstrated a role for vamp-7 ( 50% inhibition ) but not vamp-2 and vamp-3 .<br />similarly , lippert et al .<br />demonstrated that recombinant vamp-8 inhibited ca-/gtps - mediated degranulation in permeabilized rbl-2h3 cells by 30% .<br />our group 's sirna studies also implicate snap-23 and syntaxin 4 as essential for rbl-2h3 degranulation , as knockdown of these snares resulted in 30% inhibition of degranulation when compared to control sirna treatment .<br />in support of our data ,<br />salinas et al .<br />demonstrated that in permeabilized rpmc , neutralizing antibodies to snap-23 and syntaxin 4 resulted in 25% and 65% inhibition of histamine release .<br />in addition , sander et al .<br />demonstrated that neutralizing antibodies to snap-23 and syntaxin 4 inhibited histamine release from permeabilized human mast cells with inhibition reaching 90% and 40% , respectively .<br />earlier studies by guo et al .<br />demonstrated that anti - snap-23 neutralizing antibody decreased rpmc degranulation , although this inhibition required high antibody concentrations ( 500 g / ml ) .<br />recently , suzuki et al .<br />demonstrated that a shrna to snap-23 knocked down degranulation in stimulated rbl-2h3 cells by 30% , similar to the maximal inhibition we have observed for snap-23 .<br />in addition , liu et al .<br />demonstrated that treatment of rbl-2h3 cells with syntaxin 4 sirna resulted in a decrease in antigen - induced histamine and -hexosaminidase release .<br />interestingly , various groups [ 13 , 14 , 29 , 37 ] have implicated syntaxin 4 , vamp-7 and snap-23 in mast cell degranulation via overexpression studies .<br />overexpression of syntaxin 4 , vamp-7 and snap-23 all had an effect on degranulation in rbl-2h3 cells , although the effects were manifested as either an augmentation or inhibition of degranulation .<br />the exact mechanism leading to augmentation or inhibition has yet to be elucidated but may involve competition for free snare proteins or competition for regulatory proteins .<br />because many of the snare - deficient transgenic mice are embryonic lethal ( table 4 ) , sirna methods may represent the only efficient way to characterize degranulation pathways in both in vitro and in vivo models of anaphylaxis and autoimmune disease .<br />mast cell phenotype of snare knockout animals / cells these reports provide evidence that these snares do not participate in the mast cell degranulation process .<br />there are a number of studies published recently that utilize sirna to validate the role of individual snares or snare complexes mediating trafficking events in various cell types [ 46 - 54 ] .<br />however , an interesting report published recently   eloquently suggests that the abundance of snare - member isoforms and therefore the overall increase in snare redundancy may play a major role in the lack of snare sirna cellular efficacy .<br />in addition , the authors describe the phenomenon that many cell types appear to express a sizeable reserve of snare proteins not required for normal physiological cellular processes ( a so - called  snare reserve ) .<br />interestingly , the literature is scant with respect to sirna studies characterizing snare - protein function in mast cells .<br />in addition , as snares are intracellular targets , the use of biotherapeutics such as recombinant proteins or neutralizing antibodies is not possible as these large proteins can not as of yet be targeted to the inside of the cell .<br />therefore , interfering rna offers an exciting new approach for the development of a snare - directed therapy .<br />to date , several sirna - based therapies have initiated clinical trials for the treatment of viral diseases , cancer and macular degeneration .<br />in addition , our sirna data identifies snap-23 and syntaxin 4 as essential for rbl-2h3 degranulation , and knockdown of these snares resulted in 30% inhibition of degranulation when compared to control sirna treatment .<br />these studies reflect the effect that a snare sirna therapeutic could have as we utilized whole cells stimulated with physiologic stimuli .<br />however , additional studies focused on in vivo delivery of these sirna and testing in animal models of disease are warranted .<br />sec1/munc18 ( sm ) proteins are arch - shaped cytosolic proteins that have been demonstrated to bind syntaxins and regulate intracellular trafficking [ 57 , 58 ] .<br />specifically , munc182 has been demonstrated to play a role in mast cell degranulation [ 15 , 26 , 31 ] .<br />sm proteins appear to regulate snare activity in several ways [ 57 -

snare complexes that are fusion <br />ready.<br />these  docked vesicles persist for a substantial period of time until ca influx triggers the final step of fusion and cargo ( neurotransmitter ) release through the actions of ca sensors such as synaptotagmin and complexins .<br />various investigators have reported the expression of multiple snares in murine and human mast cells [ 12 , 13 , 15 , 17 , 1922 , 2431 ] .<br />composite rt - pcr data identifying snare mrna in murine and human mast cells are presented in table 1 .<br />the neuronal snare snap-25 showed weak mrna expression in human mast cells , but was not detected via western blot in the same study .<br />multiple studies report the expression of several vamp family representatives mrna [ vamp-1 , 2 , 3 , 7 , 8 ( r snares ) ] and several members of the syntaxin family [ syntaxin 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ( qa snares ) ] as well .<br />snare family mrna expression in murine and human mast cells immunoblotting studies confirm that snap-23 is the consensus representative of the qb , c family in both murine and human mast cells ( see composite of protein expression data presented in table 2 ) .<br />interestingly , two groups have reported the expression of the neuronal snap-25 qb , c snare protein in primary murine mast cells via immunoblot and immunohistochemistry [ 25 , 27 ] .<br />these data could not be recapitulated in published work by several groups in primary murine mast cells [ 12 , 22 ] and the rat cell line rbl-2h3 [ 13 , 22 , 24 ] .<br />the reason[s ] behind this discrepancy is not clear , but may involve specificity of antibodies and/or limits of detection of signal .<br />protein expression of vamp and syntaxin family members correlate well with mrna studies , as the majority of snares detected via rt - pcr were also detected via immunoblot .<br />snare family protein expression ( via immunoblotting ) in murine and human mast cells immunohistochemistry studies in primary murine mast cells [ 12 , 18 , 21 ] have demonstrated that snap-23 and syntaxin 4 localize to the plasma membrane , while syntaxin 3 , vamp-2 and vamp-8 appear to localize to secretory granules .<br />detected snap-25 expression in the secretory granules of rat primary mast cells ( rpmc ) .<br />similar immunohistochemistry results in rbl-2h3 cells [ 13 , 14 , 24 , 29 , 31 ] have been reported demonstrating plasma membrane localization of snap-23 , syntaxin 4<br />and syntaxin 3 ; and secretory granule localization of syntaxin 3 , vamp-2 , 3 , 7 and 8 . in human mast cells ,<br />sander et al .<br />demonstrated that snap-23 and syntaxin 4 localize in the plasma membrane while vamp-3 , vamp-7 and vamp-8 are dispersed throughout the cytoplasm , suggesting granule localization .<br />however , upon activation of the mast cell , only vamp-7 and vamp-8 appear to redistribute to the periphery of the cell , suggesting fusion and degranulation .<br />immunoprecipitation ( ip ) pull - down studies in primary murine mast cells , rbl-2h3 cells , and human mast cells have identified snare complexes composed of snap-23 and syntaxin 4 in complex with the r - snares , vamp-2 [ 13 , 18 , 28 , 29 ] , vamp-8 [ 13 , 15 , 17 , 18 , 22 ] ; vamp-7   and vamp-3 .<br />in addition , complexes composed of snap-23 , syntaxin 3 and vamp-8 also co - precipitated .<br />.<br />demonstrated that ip with anti - snap-23 antibody in rbl-2h3 cells pulled down syntaxin 2 , 3 , 4 and vamp-2 , 3 , 8 .<br />interestingly , n - ethylmaleimide ( nem ) treatment was required to observe vamp-8 co - precipitation .<br />it was also demonstrated that ip with anti - syntaxin 4 resulted in the co - precipitation of snap-23 , vamp-2 , vamp-3 and vamp-8 , while ip with anti - syntaxin 2 or syntaxin 3 only pulled down snap-23 .<br />these data suggest that ternary complexes in rbl-2h3 cells consist of snap-23 , syntaxin 4 and a member of the r - snares family , presumably vamp-2 , 3 or 8 .<br />showed that in rbl-2h3 cell lysates ; syntaxin 4 co - precipitated with snap-23 and vamp-8 within and outside of lipid rafts ; however , syntaxin 3 , snap-23 and vamp-8 co - precipitates were found to be complexed only within lipid rafts .<br />the implication of these two different complexes and their unequal distribution in the membrane remains unclear .<br />additional studies by hepp et al .<br />demonstrated co - precipitated complexes of snap-23 , vamp-2 and syntaxin 4 in rbl-2h3 cells and also showed that most of the snap-23 associated with vamp-2 and syntaxin 4 in these complexes is phosphorylated .<br />an elegant study by puri et al .<br />demonstrated that snap-23 , syntaxin 4 , vamp-2 complexes are present in lipid rafts and showed that snap-23 functions to recruit non - lipid raft - associated syntaxin 4 into a functional complex .<br />once again it was demonstrated that a predominant proportion of the snap-23 in complexes was phosphorylated , implicating snap-23 phosphorylation as a key prerequisite to complex formation .<br />our group has demonstrated that in rbl-2h3 cells , snap-23 co - precipitates with syntaxin 4 and vamp-8 ; however , nem treatment was needed to observe vamp-8 association .<br />in human mast cells isolated from surgical tissues , sander et al<br />.<br />demonstrated that snap-23 co - precipitated with syntaxin 4 , vamp-7 and vamp-8 , but not vamp-2 and vamp-3 .<br />in<br />derived mast cells , vamp-8 was shown to associate preferentially with syntaxin 4 and snap-23 , and to a lesser degree , vamp-2 .<br />however , it appears that vamp-2 and vamp-3   may act to substitute for vamp-8 in vamp-8-deficient cells , perhaps due to an unusual compensatory mechanism .<br />isolation of ternary complexes of snare proteins after cellular activation has proven anything but trivial .<br />previous data have demonstrated that only 5% of the snap-23 present in rbl-2h3 cells is actually capable of forming a complex after activation .<br />furthermore , it is suggested that snare complexes have limited lifespans after activation - induced formation [ 35 , 36 ] .<br />using recombinant snare proteins , foster et al .<br />demonstrated the in vitro association of the recombinant snares , snap-23 , vamp-2 and syntaxin 4 and further demonstrated that deletion of the amino terminus and the second coiled - coil domain of snap-23 inhibited binding to both vamp-2 and syntaxin 4 .<br />although immunolocalization and ip studies identify the individual snare proteins and their complexes associated with mast cell function , functional studies aimed at disrupting snare complex formation / action provide a practical method to dissect the role of these complexes in mast cell degranulation .<br />snare proteins also function to mediate constitutive trafficking events through both endocytic and secretory pathways ; reviewed in hong et al .<br />previously published functional data have implicated the snares snap-23 , syntaxin 4 , vamp-2 , vamp-3 , vamp-7 and vamp-8 in mast cell degranulation in studies using streptolysin - o - permeabilized cells and inhibitory recombinant snare proteins , snare neutralizing antibodies [ 12 , 17 , 19 ] ; overexpression studies [ 13 , 14 , 22 , 29 , 38 ] , rna interference methods [ 20 , 22 , 39 ] and snare - deficient mice [ 18 , 21 ] .<br />a compilation of functional data implicating the various snare proteins is presented in table 3 .<br />functional data implicating snare proteins in mast cell degranulation the most compelling evidence for the role of snare proteins in mast cell degranulation is presented in data describing vamp-8-deficient mice [ 18 , 21 ] .<br />.<br />demonstrated that mast cells derived from the bone marrow of these mice [ bmmc ] had a 50% decrease in their ability to release -hexosaminidase and serotonin but had normal histamine and tnf- release .<br />tiwari et al .<br />showed that bmmc from vamp-8-deficient mice resulted in a 50% decrease in -hexosaminidase and histamine , but no changes in cytokine / chemokine release .<br />our group has shown via sirna that we could demonstrate about a 50% knockdown in rbl-2h3 degranulation after targeting vamp-8 mrna / protein .<br />interestingly , puri et al .<br />also showed that vamp-2 and vamp-3 do not play a role in mast cell degranulation as bmmc derived from vamp-3-deficient animals and mast cells derived from vamp-2-deficient stem cells showed normal degranulation .<br />these data are confirmed by studies with tetanus toxins [ 17 , 40 ] , which are known to cleave and inactivate vamp-2 but do not have any effect on mast cell degranulation .<br />supporting evidence for the role of vamp-8 in mast cell degranulation comes from sander et al . , who demonstrated that neutralizing anti - vamp-8 antibodies inhibit degranulation in streptolysin - permeabilized human mast cells by 60% .<br />data from this report also demonstrated a role for vamp-7 ( 50% inhibition ) but not vamp-2 and vamp-3 .<br />similarly , lippert et al .<br />demonstrated that recombinant vamp-8 inhibited ca-/gtps - mediated degranulation in permeabilized rbl-2h3 cells by 30% .<br />our group 's sirna studies also implicate snap-23 and syntaxin 4 as essential for rbl-2h3 degranulation , as knockdown of these snares resulted in 30% inhibition of degranulation when compared to control sirna treatment .<br />in support of our data ,<br />salinas et al .<br />demonstrated that in permeabilized rpmc , neutralizing antibodies to snap-23 and syntaxin 4 resulted in 25% and 65% inhibition of histamine release .<br />in addition , sander et al .<br />demonstrated that neutralizing antibodies to snap-23 and syntaxin 4 inhibited histamine release from permeabilized human mast cells with inhibition reaching 90% and 40% , respectively .<br />earlier studies by guo et al .<br />demonstrated that anti - snap-23 neutralizing antibody decreased rpmc degranulation , although this inhibition required high antibody concentrations ( 500 g / ml ) .<br />recently , suzuki et al .<br />demonstrated that a shrna to snap-23 knocked down degranulation in stimulated rbl-2h3 cells by 30% , similar to the maximal inhibition we have observed for snap-23 .<br />in addition , liu et al .<br />demonstrated that treatment of rbl-2h3 cells with syntaxin 4 sirna resulted in a decrease in antigen - induced histamine and -hexosaminidase release .<br />interestingly , various groups [ 13 , 14 , 29 , 37 ] have implicated syntaxin 4 , vamp-7 and snap-23 in mast cell degranulation via overexpression studies .<br />overexpression of syntaxin 4 , vamp-7 and snap-23 all had an effect on degranulation in rbl-2h3 cells , although the effects were manifested as either an augmentation or inhibition of degranulation .<br />the exact mechanism leading to augmentation or inhibition has yet to be elucidated but may involve competition for free snare proteins or competition for regulatory proteins .<br />because many of the snare - deficient transgenic mice are embryonic lethal ( table 4 ) , sirna methods may represent the only efficient way to characterize degranulation pathways in both in vitro and in vivo models of anaphylaxis and autoimmune disease .<br />mast cell phenotype of snare knockout animals / cells these reports provide evidence that these snares do not participate in the mast cell degranulation process .<br />there are a number of studies published recently that utilize sirna to validate the role of individual snares or snare complexes mediating trafficking events in various cell types [ 46 - 54 ] .<br />however , an interesting report published recently   eloquently suggests that the abundance of snare - member isoforms and therefore the overall increase in snare redundancy may play a major role in the lack of snare sirna cellular efficacy .<br />in addition , the authors describe the phenomenon that many cell types appear to express a sizeable reserve of snare proteins not required for normal physiological cellular processes ( a so - called  snare reserve ) .<br />interestingly , the literature is scant with respect to sirna studies characterizing snare - protein function in mast cells .<br />in addition , as snares are intracellular targets , the use of biotherapeutics such as recombinant proteins or neutralizing antibodies is not possible as these large proteins can not as of yet be targeted to the inside of the cell .<br />therefore , interfering rna offers an exciting new approach for the development of a snare - directed therapy .<br />to date , several sirna - based therapies have initiated clinical trials for the treatment of viral diseases , cancer and macular degeneration .<br />in addition , our sirna data identifies snap-23 and syntaxin 4 as essential for rbl-2h3 degranulation , and knockdown of these snares resulted in 30% inhibition of degranulation when compared to control sirna treatment .<br />these studies reflect the effect that a snare sirna therapeutic could have as we utilized whole cells stimulated with physiologic stimuli .<br />however , additional studies focused on in vivo delivery of these sirna and testing in animal models of disease are warranted .<br />sec1/munc18 ( sm ) proteins are arch - shaped cytosolic proteins that have been demonstrated to bind syntaxins and regulate intracellular trafficking [ 57 , 58 ] .<br />specifically , munc182 has been demonstrated to play a role in mast cell degranulation [ 15 , 26 , 31 ] .<br />sm proteins appear to regulate snare activity in several ways [ 57 - 60 ] .<br />they can bind non - complexed syntaxins and act as negative regulators of snare assembly and interestingly , can also bind to trans - complexes and promote fusion .<br />members of the munc13 family of accessory proteins also have been demonstrated to act as positive regulators of mast cell degranulation .<br />complexins are cytosolic snare regulatory proteins that bind snare complexes and  lock the snare machinery into a primed state awaiting a final trigger of fusion events [ 57 , 60 ] .<br />specifically , complexin ii has been demonstrated to function as a positive regulator of mast cell degranulation as sirna to complexin ii attenuates ige - induced degranulation .<br />synaptotagmins are type i membrane calcium binding proteins that facilitate the formation of the snare  calcium<br /> phospholipid complex that triggers final fusion and release of mediators from the cell [ 57 , 60 ] . in mast cells ,<br />the rab family of gtpases has been implicated in the control of degranulation in mast cells .<br />secretory carrier membrane proteins ( scamps ) are accessory proteins that play a role in the regulation of mast cell degranulation .<br />scamp-1 and scamp-2 are postulated to function at the later stages of membrane fusion , in concert with phospholipase d , to form functional fusion pores .<br />finally ,<br />as previously mentioned vide supra , snare disassembly is mediated by the proteins snap and the atpase nsf [ 60 , 64 ] .<br />snap functions to capture the snare complex and allow the binding of nsf and the subsequent disassembly of the snare complex .<br />the important qb , c and qa snares on the plasma membrane unequivocally appear to be snap-23 and syntaxin 4 , while the most likely r - snare partners on the vesicle membranes appear to be both vamp-7 and vamp-8 ( fig .<br />1 ) .<br />functionally , there is growing evidence that ternary complexes of the above snares are critically involved in the mast cell degranulation process .<br />disruption of these complex 's formation or interactions with regulators may offer a window for therapeutic intervention and the development of novel small molecules for the treatment of allergic and autoimmune disease .<br />model of the mast cell snare complex mediating degranulation based on functional findings [ 1214 , 1622 , 29 , 3738 ] .<br />( a ) snap-23 and syntaxin 4 represent the consensus plasma membrane snares involved in mast cell degranulation .<br />under normal physiological conditions , vamp-7 and/or vamp-8 represent the secretory granule ( vesicle ) snare that interacts with snap-23 and syntaxin 4 to form a functional ternary complex .<br />( b ) in the absence of vamp-8 , it appears that a compensatory mechanism may allow vamp-2 and/or vamp-3 to associate with snap-23 and syntaxin 4 to mediate ternary complex formation and possible function .", "summary": "<pad> the snare family of proteins plays an important role in regulating vesicular assembly and disassembly. soluble n -

methyl - d - aspartate receptors ( nmdars ) that are widespread in the central nervous system .<br />the nmdars constitute a major class of ionotropic glutamate receptors and play an essential role in synaptic transmission , plasticity , and memory .<br />activation of nmdars results in cell membrane depolarization with an equilibrium potential near 0 mv , producing the excitatory postsynaptic potential ( epsp ) and leading to an increase of ca influx into the cell .<br />the intracellular ca can in turn function as a second messenger , mediating a variety of signaling cascades .<br />excessive activation of nmdars by glutamate mediates neuronal damage in many neurological disorders including ischemia and neurodegenerative diseases ( choi et al .<br />the nmdars have long been considered the main target for the treatment of excitotoxicity - related neuronal injury , and a variety of antagonists or blockers of nmdars have been developed .<br />unfortunately , the results of clinical trials have been disappointing because of the obvious side effects associated with blocking the physiological roles of nmdars ( chen and lipton , 2006 ) .<br />therefore , a better understanding of the mechanism of how nmdars can be modulated by regulatory proteins should help in the development of new therapeutic agents to counteract overactive nmda receptor function , and may represent an alternative to treating nmdar - mediated excitotoxic injury .<br />this short review focuses on the specific negative modulation of nmdars by a neuronal calcium sensor ( ncs ) protein , dream / calsenilin / kchip3 .<br />nmdars are believed to be heterotetrameric complexes composed of combinations of the obligatory nr1 subunit and nr2 and/or nr3 subunits ( chazot and stephenson , 1997 ; laube et al .<br />, 1998 ; schorge and colquhoun , 2003 ; furukawa et al . , 2005 ) .<br />the nr1 subunit is encoded by a single gene but exists as eight functional splice variants , while the nr2 ( nr2a - b ) and nr3 ( nr3a - b ) subunits are encoded by four and two different genes , respectively .<br />the nmdar subunits form a central ion conductance pathway selective for cations such as na , k , and ca , and share a common membrane topology , with each subunit consisting of four transmembrane ( tm ) domains ( m1m4 ) .<br />the long extracellular n - terminal regions of nmdar subunits are organized as a tandem of two domains .<br />the first domain , called the n - terminal domain ( ntd ) that includes the first 380 amino acids , is involved in tetrameric assembly ( mayer , 2006 ; paoletti and neyton , 2007 ; stroebel et al . ,<br />the second domain of about 300 amino acids is known as the agonist - binding domain ( abd ) that precedes the tm1 domain .<br />the abd binds glycine ( or d - serine ) in the nr1 and nr3 subunits , whereas the nr2 abd binds glutamate ( furukawa et al .<br />, 2005 ; yao and mayer , 2006 ) .<br />the pore loop ( p loop ) , or the m2 region , forms the narrowest constriction of the channel ion conductance pathway and determines the permeation properties of nmdars .<br />the nmdars feature an intracellular c - terminal tail of about 400600 residues that has a strong diversity in its amino acid sequence .<br />the c - terminal tails of nmdar subunits contain a series of short motifs that interact with intracellular factors or binding partners involved in receptor trafficking , anchoring and signaling ( skeberdis et al .<br />activation of nmdars requires a simultaneous binding of two co - agonists , glutamate , and glycine with different biophysical properties of ion permeation .<br />the typical nmdars contain nr2 subunits with properties of high permeability to ca and extracellular mg block at hyperpolarized membrane potentials ( wrighton et al .<br />different from conventional nr1/nr2 heterotetramers , nr3-containing nmdars have unique properties with a five to tenfold decrease of ca permeability , insensitivity to mg block , and reduced single - channel conductance and open probability , functioning as a negative modulator for nmda receptor channel function ( das et al . , 1998 ;<br />2009 ; cavara et al . , 2010 ; henson et al . , 2010 ) .<br />nmda receptors are also regulated by other intracellular signals and proteins , including calcium , protein kinases , protein phosphatase calcineurin , and calcium - sensitive proteins such as calmodulin ( legendre et al . , 1993 ; vyklicky , 1993 ; lieberman and mody , 1994 ; tong et al . , 1995 ; ehlers et al . , 1996 ) .<br />calcium - dependent nmda receptor desensitization and inactivation provides a feedback mechanism capable of regulating subsequent ca entry into the postsynaptic cell through nmda channels ( figure 1 ) .<br />schematic representation for inhibitory effect of dream / calsenilin / kchip3 on nmdars in a ca - sensitive manner .<br />upon activation of nmdars by glutamate<br />binding , ca influx through nmdars increases the association between dream and nr1 subunits , resulting in reduced surface expression of nmdars , and subsequent inhibition of nmdars - mediated ca influx and excitotoxicity .<br />dream functions as a ca - sensitive modulator for the negative feedback control of nmdar function .<br />so far , a number of nr1 or nr2 subunit binding partners have been identified in the postsynaptic density .<br />the nr1 binding proteins include calmodulin ( cam ) ( ehlers et al . , 1996 ; akyol et al . , 2004<br />) , ca / cam - dependent protein kinase ii ( camkii ) ( leonard et al . , 2002 ) , -actinin ( wyszynski et al . , 1997 ; merrill et al . , 2007 ) ,<br />tubulin ( van rossum et al . , 1999 ) , spectrin ( wechsler and teichberg , 1998 ) , neurofilament ( ehlers et al . ,<br />calmodulin binding to the nr1 subunit is ca dependent and occurs with homomeric nr1 complexes , heteromeric nr1/nr2 subunit complexes from expression systems , and nmda receptors from the brain .<br />calmodulin binding to nr1 causes a fourfold reduction in nmda channel open probability , mediating the negative modulation of nmdar function ( ehlers et al . , 1998 ) .<br />the downstream regulatory element antagonist modulator ( dream ) protein , first identified in the nucleus as a ca - regulated transcriptional repressor through its binding to dna at specific regulatory elements , contains four ca - binding ef - hand domains and belongs to the ncs family ( carrion et al . , 1999 ; burgoyne , 2007 ) .<br />dream was named for its ability to block gene expression in its ca - free form via direct binding with the downstream regulatory element ( dre ) sequence in target genes such as preprodynorphin ( ppd ) , c - fos , hrk , na , and ca exchanger ncx3 ( carrion et al .<br />, 1999 ; sanz et al . , 2001 ; gomez - villafuertes et al . ,<br />dream was also named calsenilin or kv channel interacting protein 3 ( kchip3 )<br />( buxbaum et al . , 1998 ; an et al . , 2000<br />) , indicating that dream / calsenilin / kchip3 has multifunctional properties .<br />in the nucleus<br />the dream protein functions as a dimer , whereas outside the nucleus kchip3 is a monomer and regulates the surface expression and gating kinetics of kv4 channels ( an et al . , 2000 ;<br />kim and sheng , 2004 ; scannevin et al . , 2004 ; pioletti et al .<br />dream / calsenilin / kchip3 is preferentially expressed in the central nervous system , as well as in non - neuronal tissues ( link et al .<br />dream / calsenilin / kchip3 knock - out mice display a hypoalgesic phenotype , suggesting a critical role of dream / calsenilin / kchip3 in pain modulation ( cheng et al . ,<br />in addition , emerging evidence reveals the role of dream / calsenilin / kchip3 in long - term potentiation ( ltp ) ( lilliehook et al . , 2003 ) and learning and memory ( alexander et al . , 2009 ; fontan - lozano et al . , 2009 ) , suggesting a possible connection between dream and nmda function .<br />kchip13 were initially identified from a rat brain library in yeast two - hybrid ( yth ) screens using the cytoplasmic n - terminal domain ( amino acids 1180 ) of rat kv4.3 as a bait ( an et al . , 2000 ) .<br />similarly , kchip4 from mouse and human was accidentally cloned using the c - terminal 43 amino acid residues of presenilin 2 ( ps2 , amino acids 406448 ) as a bait in the yth system ( morohashi et al . , 2002 ) .<br />kchip4 , also known as calsenilin - like protein ( calp ) , binds to ps2 which is known to facilitate intramembranous -cleavage of -amyloid protein precursor ( app )<br />( morohashi et al . , 2002 ) .<br />kchip14 ( 216  256 amino acids ) can co - immunoprecipitate and co - localize with either kv4 from co - transfected cells or kv4 -subunits from tissues , and thus constitute integral components of native kv4 channel complexes ( wang , 2008 ) .<br />kchip14<br />all share a conserved carboxy - terminal core region that contains four ef - hand - like calcium binding motifs , but have a variable amino - terminal region that causes diverse modulation of kv4 trafficking and channel function ( an et al .<br />, 2000 ; holmqvist et al . , 2002 ; scannevin et al . , 2004 ;<br />findings from co - immunoprecipitation experiments show that dream antibody can immunoprecipitate endogenous nr1 subunit and dream protein from rat hippocampal tissue ( zhang et al . , 2010 ) .<br />in the reciprocal co - ip studies in hek 293 cells expressing dream and nr1 - 1a ( nr1a ) proteins , nr1 antibody can also immunoprecipitate dream along with the nr1 subunit .<br />gst pull - down assays reveal that the n - terminus of dream directly interacts with the nr1a c - terminus , and that the dream - nr1 interaction is sensitive to ca and depends on the ef hand domains of dream ( zhang et al . , 2010 ) .<br />psd-95 is a major scaffolding protein in the postsynaptic density , tethering nmdars to signaling proteins , and is critical for nmda receptor function ( kim and sheng , 2004 ) .<br />wu et al . generated a line of transgenic mice ( tgdream ) overexpressing a dominant active dream mutant , and compared nmda receptor - mediated epscs in tgdream and wild - type mice under conditions of various stimulation intensities ( wu et al .<br />they found that the amplitude of nmda receptor - mediated epscs in tgdream mice is significantly reduced compared to that in wild - type mice ( wu et al . , 2010 ) .<br />in addition , ltd is significantly reduced in tgdream mice whereas ltp is not affected by dream , demonstrating that dream interacts with psd-95 , and that the interaction is negatively regulated by calcium ( wu et al . ,<br />2010 ) . in xenopus oocytes expressing nr2b - containing nmdars alone or together with dream ,<br />two - electrode voltage clamp recordings show that , in the absence of dream , the peak currents of nmda channels activated by glutamate ( plus glycine ) are suppressed by dream , and the current decrease is caused by a reduction in the density of nmdars at the cell surface ( figure 1 ; zhang et al . , 2010 ) .<br />fontan - lozano et al .<br />recently provided another piece of evidence that dream negatively regulates the function of nmda receptors ( fontan - lozano et al . , 2011 ) .<br />by taking advantage of mice lacking the dream protein , they demonstrated that the facilitated learning induced by decreased expression of kv4.2 in dream mice requires the activation of nmda receptors containing the nr2b subunit ( fontan - lozano et al . , 2011 ) .<br />this study not only indicates the significance of the balance between kv4 channel function and nmdar activity , but also suggests the formation of a functional complex between dream / kv4.2/nmdars that regulates the synaptic efficacy mediating synaptic plasticity and learning .<br />excitotoxicity is caused by overactivation of nmda receptor function , and inhibition of nmdars can reverse the neuronal toxicity .<br />the data available so far support both the pro - apoptotic and anti - apoptotic roles of dream .<br />in general , the pro - apoptotic role of dream closely correlates with its interaction with presenilins , the production of amyloid beta ( a ) and the modulation in ca signaling , whereas the anti - apoptotic role of dream is conferred by its transcriptional repressor activity on the apoptotic protein hrk .<br />jo et al . reported that hela cells transiently transfected with dream exhibit the morphological and biochemical features of apoptosis and that expression of presenilin potentiates dream - induced apoptosis ( jo et al . , 2001 ) .<br />jo et al . also reported that dream expression increases in either human neuroblastoma sk - n - be2(c ) cells or rat neuroblastoma b103 cells after exposure to a , but no other apoptotic inducers such as staurosporine , thapsigargin , and calcium ionophore a23187 .<br />the pro - apoptotic role of dream is selectively induced during ab toxicity .<br />because of the involvement of presenilins/-secretase in a formation and neuronal death , dream coordinates with presenilin activity to play a crucial role in these processes through binding with the c - terminus of presenilins ( jo et al . , 2003 , 2004 ) .<br />stably expressed dream in h4 neuroglioma cells which showed no initiation of apoptosis in the absence of apoptosis triggers , and the apoptosis - associated caspase and calpain activities were not affected by dream ( lilliehook et al .<br />on the other hand , binding of the transcriptional repressor dream to the hrk gene avoids inappropriate hrk expression and apoptosis in hematopoietic progenitor cell lines ( sanz et al . , 2001 , 2002 ) .<br />nevertheless , the precise function of dream in pro - apoptosis and anti - apoptosis remains to be explored .<br />from our previous observations<br />, we noticed that cell viability is affected by the amount of exogenous dream gene and the method of transfection .<br />however , we could not observe any obvious morphological changes associated with cell death after the transfection of dream .<br />to prove the cytoprotective role of dream , we utilized cell lines and primary cultured hippocampal neurons with dream overexpression or sirna - mediated knockdown , and evaluated lactate dehydrogenase ( ldh ) leakage and propidium iodide ( pi ) uptake both in nmda and oxygen - glucose deprivation ( ogd ) -induced excitotoxic injury models ( zhang et al . , 2010 ) .<br />administration of nmda markedly increases the number of pi - positive cells ( dead cells ) in nmdar - transfected cho cells , whereas co - expression of dream greatly reduces pi - positive cells ( zhang et al . , 2010 ) .<br />ogd is commonly used in vitro to mimic ischemia -

containing nmdars alone or together with dream ,<br />two - electrode voltage clamp recordings show that , in the absence of dream , the peak currents of nmda channels activated by glutamate ( plus glycine ) are suppressed by dream , and the current decrease is caused by a reduction in the density of nmdars at the cell surface ( figure 1 ; zhang et al . , 2010 ) .<br />fontan - lozano et al .<br />recently provided another piece of evidence that dream negatively regulates the function of nmda receptors ( fontan - lozano et al . , 2011 ) .<br />by taking advantage of mice lacking the dream protein , they demonstrated that the facilitated learning induced by decreased expression of kv4.2 in dream mice requires the activation of nmda receptors containing the nr2b subunit ( fontan - lozano et al . , 2011 ) .<br />this study not only indicates the significance of the balance between kv4 channel function and nmdar activity , but also suggests the formation of a functional complex between dream / kv4.2/nmdars that regulates the synaptic efficacy mediating synaptic plasticity and learning .<br />excitotoxicity is caused by overactivation of nmda receptor function , and inhibition of nmdars can reverse the neuronal toxicity .<br />the data available so far support both the pro - apoptotic and anti - apoptotic roles of dream .<br />in general , the pro - apoptotic role of dream closely correlates with its interaction with presenilins , the production of amyloid beta ( a ) and the modulation in ca signaling , whereas the anti - apoptotic role of dream is conferred by its transcriptional repressor activity on the apoptotic protein hrk .<br />jo et al . reported that hela cells transiently transfected with dream exhibit the morphological and biochemical features of apoptosis and that expression of presenilin potentiates dream - induced apoptosis ( jo et al . , 2001 ) .<br />jo et al . also reported that dream expression increases in either human neuroblastoma sk - n - be2(c ) cells or rat neuroblastoma b103 cells after exposure to a , but no other apoptotic inducers such as staurosporine , thapsigargin , and calcium ionophore a23187 .<br />the pro - apoptotic role of dream is selectively induced during ab toxicity .<br />because of the involvement of presenilins/-secretase in a formation and neuronal death , dream coordinates with presenilin activity to play a crucial role in these processes through binding with the c - terminus of presenilins ( jo et al . , 2003 , 2004 ) .<br />stably expressed dream in h4 neuroglioma cells which showed no initiation of apoptosis in the absence of apoptosis triggers , and the apoptosis - associated caspase and calpain activities were not affected by dream ( lilliehook et al .<br />on the other hand , binding of the transcriptional repressor dream to the hrk gene avoids inappropriate hrk expression and apoptosis in hematopoietic progenitor cell lines ( sanz et al . , 2001 , 2002 ) .<br />nevertheless , the precise function of dream in pro - apoptosis and anti - apoptosis remains to be explored .<br />from our previous observations<br />, we noticed that cell viability is affected by the amount of exogenous dream gene and the method of transfection .<br />however , we could not observe any obvious morphological changes associated with cell death after the transfection of dream .<br />to prove the cytoprotective role of dream , we utilized cell lines and primary cultured hippocampal neurons with dream overexpression or sirna - mediated knockdown , and evaluated lactate dehydrogenase ( ldh ) leakage and propidium iodide ( pi ) uptake both in nmda and oxygen - glucose deprivation ( ogd ) -induced excitotoxic injury models ( zhang et al . , 2010 ) .<br />administration of nmda markedly increases the number of pi - positive cells ( dead cells ) in nmdar - transfected cho cells , whereas co - expression of dream greatly reduces pi - positive cells ( zhang et al . , 2010 ) .<br />ogd is commonly used in vitro to mimic ischemia - reperfusion insult to the brain , and ogd treatment induces a significant increase of ldh release ( dawson et al . , 1994 ) .<br />with over - expression of dream , however , ogd treatment induces a smaller increase in ldh release .<br />these results indicate that the over -

associated caspase and calpain activities were not affected by dream ( lilliehook et al .<br />on the other hand , binding of the transcriptional repressor dream to the hrk gene avoids inappropriate hrk expression and apoptosis in hematopoietic progenitor cell lines ( sanz et al . , 2001 , 2002 ) .<br />nevertheless , the precise function of dream in pro - apoptosis and anti - apoptosis remains to be explored .<br />from our previous observations<br />, we noticed that cell viability is affected by the amount of exogenous dream gene and the method of transfection .<br />however , we could not observe any obvious morphological changes associated with cell death after the transfection of dream .<br />to prove the cytoprotective role of dream , we utilized cell lines and primary cultured hippocampal neurons with dream overexpression or sirna - mediated knockdown , and evaluated lactate dehydrogenase ( ldh ) leakage and propidium iodide ( pi ) uptake both in nmda and oxygen - glucose deprivation ( ogd ) -induced excitotoxic injury models ( zhang et al . , 2010 ) .<br />administration of nmda markedly increases the number of pi - positive cells ( dead cells ) in nmdar - transfected cho cells , whereas co - expression of dream greatly reduces pi - positive cells ( zhang et al . , 2010 ) .<br />ogd is commonly used in vitro to mimic ischemia - reperfusion insult to the brain , and ogd treatment induces a significant increase of ldh release ( dawson et al . , 1994 ) .<br />with over - expression of dream , however , ogd treatment induces a smaller increase in ldh release .<br />these results indicate that the over - expression of dream attenuates nmdar - mediated excitotoxicity ( zhang et al . , 2010 ) .<br />we have previously tested the effect of dream sirna on nmda - induced current and excitotoxic injury in hippocampal neurons ( zhang et al . , 2010 ) .<br />knockdown of endogenous dream with sirna results in an increased amplitude of nmda current recorded by whole - cell patch - clamp assays .<br />after nmda exposure , pi - positive cells in the dream sirna group increase compared with control sirna , indicating the inhibitory effect of dream on nmdar - mediated current and excitotoxic injury ( zhang et al . , 2010 ) .<br />the ncs protein dream / calsenilin / kchip3 acts as an auxiliary subunit and suppresses nmda receptor channel function .<br />this negative modulation of nmda receptor function by dream likely provides a feedback mechanism by which overactive nmda receptors are inhibited .<br />therefore , targeting regulatory proteins of nmdars may represent an alternative approach to treating nmdar - mediated excitotoxic damage and providing neuroprotection .<br />the authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest .<br />the authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest .", "summary": "<pad> the n - methyl - d - aspartate receptors ( nmdars ) are a major class of ionotropic glutamate receptors and play an essential role in synaptic transmission, plasticity, and memory. excessive activation of nmdars by glutamate mediates neuronal damage in many neurological disorders including ischemia and neurodegenerative diseases. the nmdars have long been considered the main target for the treatment of excitotoxicity - related neuronal injury, and a variety of antagonists or blockers of nmdars have been developed. unfortunately, the results of clinical trials have been disappointing because of the obvious side effects associated with blocking the physiological roles of nmdars. therefore, a better understanding of the mechanism of how nmdars can be modulated by regulatory proteins should help in the development of new therapeutic agents to counteract overactive nmda receptor function, and may represent an alternative to treating nmdar - mediated excitotoxic injury. this short review focuses on the specific negative modulation of nmdars by a neuronal calcium sensor protein, dream / calsenilin / kchip3."}, "article_3_bigbird_pegasus": {"source_doc": "imaging    techniques play an important role in the diagnosis , staging , and follow -

induced metabolic changes as detected by [ f]fdg uptake .<br />enzastaurin - induced metabolic changes were evaluated using [ f]fdg uptake in two independent experiments for each tumor cell line , u87 mg and raji , respectively ( table 1 ) .<br />consistent with previous studies in nude mice , enzastaurin induced tumor growth delay in nod / scid mice implanted with u87 mg and raji ( figures 2(a ) and 2(b ) ) .<br />u87 mg cells grew slower than raji cells , and enzastaurin had a tumor growth delay mainly in the u87 mg tumor cell model ( figures 2(a ) and 2(b ) ) .<br />a significant tumor growth delay was seen in u87 mg after treatment with enzastaurin over the period of 3 weeks ( figure 2(a ) ) .<br />in the raji xenograft model<br />, there was a trend in the tumor growth delay , but not a statistically significant difference between vehicle and enzastaurin - treated groups ( figure 2(b ) ) .<br />[ f]fdg pet   imaging was evaluated using suv ( figures 2(c ) and 2(d ) ) and tumor / muscle ratio ( figures 2(e ) and 2(f ) ) .<br />enzastaurin administration did not alter tumor glucose metabolism as measured by suv changes in u87 mg xenografts ( figure 2(c ) ) .<br />compared to raji , the suv changes in u87 mg xenografts occurred at smaller signal intensities , and thus contributed to an overlap of suv measurements between vehicle- and enzastaurin - treated mice ( compare figures 2(c ) and 2(d ) ) .<br />in raji , suv uptake appeared to be increased at weeks 2 and 3 in enzastaurin - treated compared to vehicle - treated mice ( p < .10 at weeks 2 and 3 ; figure 2(d ) ) .<br />it is possible that metabolic heterogeneity of the tumor glucose metabolism in different areas of the tumor may have caused this difference in suv uptake .<br />in addition to suv , we also used tumor / muscle ratio to determine the metabolic effect of enzastaurin in tumors .<br />the tumor / muscle ratio   uses muscle tissue with its low metabolic rate to normalize the tumor tissue [ f]fdg uptake .<br />based on this analysis<br />there was no clear evidence of a metabolic change induced by enzastaurin compared to vehicle treatment ( figures 2(e ) and 2(f ) ) .<br />however , for u87 mg there was a trend in fdg uptake in enzastaurin - treated mice ( p < .10 at week 3 ) , which was not observed in raji xenografts ( figures 2(e ) and 2(f ) , resp . ) .<br />after enzastaurin treatment , we observed a trend in tumor size reduction for raji xenografts but not for u87 mg xenografts at week 2 ( p<br />while the collective analysis of all animals from 2 independent experiments did not reveal a clear distinction between enzastaurin- and vehicle - treated animals , there were some animals that did show a metabolic change after enzastaurin treatment .<br />in these cases we saw a decline only after two weeks of treatment that was essentially undetectable after the third week of treatment ( figures 3(a)3(f ) and figures 4(a)4(f ) ) .<br />the changes observed in u87 mg were different from changes observed in raji .<br />in u87 mg xenografts , [ f]fdg uptake declined after the 2nd week of treatment .<br />the raji tumors were fast growing and had large areas of necrotic tissue and some areas with newly increased [ f]fdg uptake ( figure 5 ) .<br />the growth pattern of these tumors is partly responsible for the intertumoral heterogeneity seen in this study and may contribute to the lack of detecting enzastaurin - induced changes in the tumor .<br />in this study we   used a specialized pet imaging approach which was developed to assess activity of anti - cancer agents in small animals .<br />changes in [ f]fdg uptake were generally found to correlate with reduction in tumor size as determined by caliper measurements [ 17 , 18 ] .<br />our study uses a metabolic kinase inhibitor to compare drug - mediated tumor growth reduction with metabolic alterations in vivo .<br />while previous imaging studies evaluated anti - tumor activity of cytotoxic agents , it is not clear how [ f]fdg pet imaging can help determine antitumor activity of kinase inhibitors .<br />in addition to its cost , the use of pet imaging may be limited due to the spatial resolution of current pet scanners .<br />thus , few studies have been published which evaluate the use of small animal imaging in drug discovery .<br />for the first time , we assessed the anti - tumor activity of the serine / threonine kinase inhibitor enzastaurin by [ f]fdg uptake in mice .<br />because we used nod / scid instead of conventional nude mice<br />, we first confirmed that [ f]fdg pet images could reproducibly be obtained in xenografts of glioblastoma and lymphoma .<br />this feasibility assessment was important to establish the tumor size at which [ f]fdg uptake is detectable in mice .<br />tumors had to be at least 150 mm in volume to be visualized by the scanner , and the best assessment was observed in tumors that were more than 400 mm ( figure 1 ) .<br />this is consistent with other studies which reported on the need of specific tumor sizes for scanner assessment .<br />the subsequent studies with enzastaurin treatment did not provide clear evidence of enzastaurin - induced metabolic changes in either of the two tumor types examined .<br />however , there are several possibilities why enzastaurin - induced changes were not detected by [ f]fdg pet imaging .<br />first , it is possible that enzastaurin may not have a homogenous impact on the metabolic rate in the tumor tissue .<br />although pkc isoenzymes have been implicated in cell proliferation , their specific role during glucose metabolism is still not understood .<br />on one hand , glucose can induce pkc- expression , and on the other hand , overexpression of pkc- reduces glucose uptake in cells .<br />hence , selective pkc- inhibitors have been investigated as potential treatments for diabetes .<br />whether such a pkc--dependent glucose regulation exists in tumor cells is not known .<br />considering the observation of this study , in which tumor growth delay and glucose metabolism are not correlated with enzastaurin activity in xenograft tumors , it is possible that enzastaurin is not able to modulate the complex glucose regulation in the tumor cells .<br />recently , the antiangiogenic kinase inhibitor azd2171 was also evaluated in a small animal study for its metabolic change in tumors .<br />compared to [ f]fdg pet imaging , only [ f ] fluoromethane proved as a useful tool to assess the anti - tumor activity of azd2171 .<br />therefore , it appears that only some kinase inhibitors will have metabolic changes in tumors , which can be assessed by [ f]fdg pet imaging .<br />implanted tumors tend to grow initially along the skin surface and infiltrate the underlying tissue to a lesser extent .<br />this observation might explain why perhaps the caliper measurements can be used to demonstrate anti - tumor effects while the imaging of the deeper tissue by [ f]fdg or ct is not able to detect differences of treatment effect .<br />because of the inability to delineate clearly the borders of the infiltrating tumor tissue , the current study may underestimate the metabolic change and thus lead to false - negative imaging results .<br />in some animals , we used contrast dye to delineate better the tumor border in mice .<br />, future studies will need to be conducted with contrast imaging techniques to approximate the anatomical borders of the tumor .<br />tumor weight did not correlate with caliper measurements , because ct scans or caliper measurements were taken during the course of the study , while tumor weight was collected only at the end of the study , when animals were sacrificed , and tumors had become heterogeneous .<br />finally , the observed [ f]fdg uptake signals are considerably lower relative to what is measured in humans .<br />the low baseline level in the present xenograft study negatively impacted the ability to assess early changes in metabolism associated with treatment effect .<br />other factors influencing the low uptake signal are heterogeneity of glucose uptake in tumors , possible emergence of drug - resistant tumor cells , variability of pharmacokinetic exposure of the inhibitor , and the diffusion of tracer to the tumor site .<br />in summary ,<br />our data are consistent with the hypothesis that shrinking tumor size ( assessed by caliper measurements ) does not equate to reduction in overall tumor metabolism .<br />in fact ,  pockets  of drug - resistant tumor cells with increased glucose uptake and growth kinetics may become prevalent in certain areas of the tumor , while glucose reduction will be present in other areas .<br />additional longitudinal pet imaging studies will have to examine in detail the variables which affect the accurate measurement of tumor response to drug treatment .<br />our study implies that [ f]fdg pet imaging will be useful only in a select type of tumors and perhaps detect antitumor activity only for a limited number of drugs .", "summary": "today, 2-[18f]fluoro-2-deoxy -

induced metabolic changes in either of the two tumor types examined .<br />however , there are several possibilities why enzastaurin - induced changes were not detected by [ f]fdg pet imaging .<br />first , it is possible that enzastaurin may not have a homogenous impact on the metabolic rate in the tumor tissue .<br />although pkc isoenzymes have been implicated in cell proliferation , their specific role during glucose metabolism is still not understood .<br />on one hand , glucose can induce pkc- expression , and on the other hand , overexpression of pkc- reduces glucose uptake in cells .<br />hence , selective pkc- inhibitors have been investigated as potential treatments for diabetes .<br />whether such a pkc--dependent glucose regulation exists in tumor cells is not known .<br />considering the observation of this study , in which tumor growth delay and glucose metabolism are not correlated with enzastaurin activity in xenograft tumors , it is possible that enzastaurin is not able to modulate the complex glucose regulation in the tumor cells .<br />recently , the antiangiogenic kinase inhibitor azd2171 was also evaluated in a small animal study for its metabolic change in tumors .<br />compared to [ f]fdg pet imaging , only [ f ] fluoromethane proved as a useful tool to assess the anti - tumor activity of azd2171 .<br />therefore , it appears that only some kinase inhibitors will have metabolic changes in tumors , which can be assessed by [ f]fdg pet imaging .<br />implanted tumors tend to grow initially along the skin surface and infiltrate the underlying tissue to a lesser extent .<br />this observation might explain why perhaps the caliper measurements can be used to demonstrate anti - tumor effects while the imaging of the deeper tissue by [ f]fdg or ct is not able to detect differences of treatment effect .<br />because of the inability to delineate clearly the borders of the infiltrating tumor tissue , the current study may underestimate the metabolic change and thus lead to false - negative imaging results .<br />in some animals , we used contrast dye to delineate better the tumor border in mice .<br />, future studies will need to be conducted with contrast imaging techniques to approximate the anatomical borders of the tumor .<br />tumor weight did not correlate with caliper measurements , because ct scans or caliper measurements were taken during the course of the study , while tumor weight was collected only at the end of the study , when animals were sacrificed , and tumors had become heterogeneous .<br />finally , the observed [ f]fdg uptake signals are considerably lower relative to what is measured in humans .<br />the low baseline level in the present xenograft study negatively impacted the ability to assess early changes in metabolism associated with treatment effect .<br />other factors influencing the low uptake signal are heterogeneity of glucose uptake in tumors , possible emergence of drug - resistant tumor cells , variability of pharmacokinetic exposure of the inhibitor , and the diffusion of tracer to the tumor site .<br />in summary ,<br />our data are consistent with the hypothesis that shrinking tumor size ( assessed by caliper measurements ) does not equate to reduction in overall tumor metabolism .<br />in fact ,  pockets  of drug - resistant tumor cells with increased glucose uptake and growth kinetics may become prevalent in certain areas of the tumor , while glucose reduction will be present in other areas .<br />additional longitudinal pet imaging studies will have to examine in detail the variables which affect the accurate measurement of tumor response to drug treatment .<br />our study implies that [ f]fdg pet imaging will be useful only in a select type of tumors and perhaps detect antitumor activity only for a limited number of drugs .", "summary": "background . the use of 2-[18f]fluoro-2-deoxy -

up of cancer patients .<br />while standard imaging techniques , such as computed tomography ( ct ) , are based on differences in the anatomical structure of the tissues , positron emission tomography ( pet )<br />uses radiolabeled molecular probes to assess differences in biological or biochemical properties of tissues .<br />the most commonly used tracer for pet is the glucose analogue 2-[f]fluoro-2-deoxy - d - glucose ( [ f]fdg ) , which provides an estimate of tissue glucose utilization .<br />today , [ f]fdg pet is widely used in clinical diagnoses of cancer , including lung cancer , non - hodgkin lymphoma , and glioblastoma .<br />because of this increased utility in oncology [ 57 ] , [ f]fdg pet is being evaluated as a tool to assess antitumor effects of standard or novel anticancer drugs in both human subjects and in animal models of cancer .<br />pet imaging may provide evidence of biological responses of novel anticancer compounds , which , in turn , can facilitate the transition of compounds from preclinical to clinical investigation .<br />one such novel compound is enzastaurin , which was developed as a protein kinase c - beta ( pkc- ) inhibitor .<br />the family of protein kinase c ( pkc ) has been implicated in processes that control tumor growth , survival , and progression .<br />in particular , pkc- activation has been recognized as an important contributor to malignant growth in diffuse large cell b cell lymphoma   and in glioblastoma .<br />recently , enzastaurin has shown antitumor activity in xenograft models of the colorectal cancer cell line hct116 and in the glioblastoma cell line u87 mg .<br />while enzastaurin was designed as a selective pkc-   inhibitor , recent studies suggest that its antitumor activity is modulated by activation of gsk-3 and the pi3k / akt pathway .<br />in this study we evaluated the extent to which [ f]fdg pet imaging can accurately characterize the antitumor activity of enzastaurin in two different mouse xenograft tumor models .<br />nonobese diabetic / severe combined immunodeficient ( nod / scid ) mice were raised and cared for by the indiana university simon cancer center transplant and xenograft core following the institutional guidelines of animal care .<br />the glioblastoma cell line , u87 mg , and burkitt 's lymphoma cell line , raji , were obtained from the american type culture collection ( atcc , manassas , va , usa ) and cultured as recommended by atcc .<br />as previously published , u87 mg and raji cells express high levels of pkc- [ 12 , 13 ] .<br />injection , cells were resuspended in a 1 : 1 ratio of tumor cells : matrigel ( bd biosciences , bedford , mass , usa ) and burkitt 's lymphoma cell line , raji was resuspended in a 1 : 2 ratio of tumor cells : matrigel .<br />each mouse was injected s.c .<br />in the right flank with 5  10 cells .<br />enzastaurin treatment was initiated when the tumors reached a volume of at least 150 mm .<br />mice with similar tumor sizes were matched in the control and enzastaurin treated groups .<br />enzastaurin was suspended in 10% acacia ( fisher scientific , fair lawn , nj , usa ) in water and dosed by gavage twice daily at 75 mg / kg based upon weekly body measurements for each treated group .<br />each animal was anesthetized with acepromazine ( 1 - 2<br />mg / kg i.m . )<br />and torbugesic ( 2 mg / kg i.m . ) and placed on a custom bed for imaging .<br />a static 15-minute pet study was performed using the indypet ii scanner [ 14 , 15 ] at 45 minutes posttracer injection .<br />following the pet study ,<br />the animal bed was moved to and mounted on an evs rs9 microct scanner , and a volumetric image that encompassed the tumor volume was imaged at approximately 90 micron spatial resolution .<br />fdg utilization estimatesfdg uptake estimates are generated by placing rois on pet images acquired over the time period from 4560 minutes posttracer administration .<br />indices of tumor fdg uptake were generated by calculating a ratio of the tumor to muscle uptake and by calculating the standardized uptake value ( suv ) : <br />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ( 1)suvfdg=[4560ct(t)dt](id)/m .<br />in ( 1 ) ct(t ) is the concentration of [ f-18 ] in the tumor from the pet image , m is the mass of the animal , i d is the dose of the tracer injected into the animal , and  is tissue density .<br />[ f]fdg was prepared by the hamacher method using a commercial synthesis unit provided by petnet / cti ( knoxville , tenn , usa ) .<br />fdg uptake estimates are generated by placing rois on pet images acquired over the time period from 4560 minutes posttracer administration .<br />indices of tumor fdg uptake were generated by calculating a ratio of the tumor to muscle uptake and by calculating the standardized uptake value ( suv ) : <br />\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t ( 1)suvfdg=[4560ct(t)dt](id)/m .<br />in ( 1 ) ct(t ) is the concentration of [ f-18 ] in the tumor from the pet image , m is the mass of the animal , i d is the dose of the tracer injected into the animal , and  is tissue density .<br />[ f]fdg was prepared by the hamacher method using a commercial synthesis unit provided by petnet / cti ( knoxville , tenn , usa ) .<br />endpoints included tumor volume via calipers , tumor volume via ct , pet - determined measures for tumor , muscle , tumor / muscle ratio ,   and a standardized measure of uptake .<br />changes from baseline for each endpoint were analyzed for each cell line ( u87 mg , raji ) and each time point ( week 2 , week 3 ) using nonparametric statistical methods ( wilcoxon rank - sum test ) to compare treated versus control animals .<br />due to the exploratory nature of the analyses , p - values were used to indicate trends and potential future research hypotheses , rather than to test and confirm prespecified hypotheses .<br />we first investigated whether two tumor cell lines provided acceptable tumor growth in nod / scid mice to allow reproducible imaging with [ f]fdg pet ( figure 1 ) .<br />we used u87 mg cells as a representative cell line for solid tumors , and raji as a model for hematologic cancers .<br />both the u87 mg ( figure 1(a ) ) and the raji ( data not shown ) tumor types grew consistently in nod / scid mice prior to drug treatment and [ f]fdg pet imaging reliably detected glucose uptake in xenografts as determined by standardized uptake value ( suv ) ( see materials and methods ) .<br />in these feasibility studies<br />, we also found that suv correlated with u87 mg tumor size as measured by ct ( figure 1(b ) ) .<br />based on these preliminary observations of initial tumor growth , we elected to use both tumor cell lines to evaluate enzastaurin - induced metabolic changes as detected by [ f]fdg uptake .<br />enzastaurin - induced metabolic changes were evaluated using [ f]fdg uptake in two independent experiments for each tumor cell line , u87 mg and raji , respectively ( table 1 ) .<br />consistent with previous studies in nude mice , enzastaurin induced tumor growth delay in nod / scid mice implanted with u87 mg and raji ( figures 2(a ) and 2(b ) ) .<br />u87 mg cells grew slower than raji cells , and enzastaurin had a tumor growth delay mainly in the u87 mg tumor cell model ( figures 2(a ) and 2(b ) ) .<br />a significant tumor growth delay was seen in u87 mg after treatment with enzastaurin over the period of 3 weeks ( figure 2(a ) ) .<br />in the raji xenograft model<br />, there was a trend in the tumor growth delay , but not a statistically significant difference between vehicle and enzastaurin - treated groups ( figure 2(b ) ) .<br />[ f]fdg pet   imaging was evaluated using suv ( figures 2(c ) and 2(d ) ) and tumor / muscle ratio ( figures 2(e ) and 2(f ) ) .<br />enzastaurin administration did not alter tumor glucose metabolism as measured by suv changes in u87 mg xenografts ( figure 2(c ) ) .<br />compared to raji , the suv changes in u87 mg xenografts occurred at smaller signal intensities , and thus contributed to an overlap of suv measurements between vehicle- and enzastaurin - treated mice ( compare figures 2(c ) and 2(d ) ) .<br />in raji , suv uptake appeared to be increased at weeks 2 and 3 in enzastaurin - treated compared to vehicle - treated mice ( p < .10 at weeks 2 and 3 ; figure 2(d ) ) .<br />it is possible that metabolic heterogeneity of the tumor glucose metabolism in different areas of the tumor may have caused this difference in suv uptake .<br />in addition to suv , we also used tumor / muscle ratio to determine the metabolic effect of enzastaurin in tumors .<br />the tumor / muscle ratio   uses muscle tissue with its low metabolic rate to normalize the tumor tissue [ f]fdg uptake .<br />based on this analysis<br />there was no clear evidence of a metabolic change induced by enzastaurin compared to vehicle treatment ( figures 2(e ) and 2(f ) ) .<br />however , for u87 mg there was a trend in fdg uptake in enzastaurin - treated mice ( p < .10 at week 3 ) , which was not observed in raji xenografts ( figures 2(e ) and 2(f ) , resp . ) .<br />after enzastaurin treatment , we observed a trend in tumor size reduction for raji xenografts but not for u87 mg xenografts at week 2 ( p<br />while the collective analysis of all animals from 2 independent experiments did not reveal a clear distinction between enzastaurin- and vehicle - treated animals , there were some animals that did show a metabolic change after enzastaurin treatment .<br />in these cases we saw a decline only after two weeks of treatment that was essentially undetectable after the third week of treatment ( figures 3(a)3(f ) and figures 4(a)4(f ) ) .<br />the changes observed in u87 mg were different from changes observed in raji .<br />in u87 mg xenografts , [ f]fdg uptake declined after the 2nd week of treatment .<br />the raji tumors were fast growing and had large areas of necrotic tissue and some areas with newly increased [ f]fdg uptake ( figure 5 ) .<br />the growth pattern of these tumors is partly responsible for the intertumoral heterogeneity seen in this study and may contribute to the lack of detecting enzastaurin - induced changes in the tumor .<br />in this study we   used a specialized pet imaging approach which was developed to assess activity of anti - cancer agents in small animals .<br />changes in [ f]fdg uptake were generally found to correlate with reduction in tumor size as determined by caliper measurements [ 17 , 18 ] .<br />our study uses a metabolic kinase inhibitor to compare drug -

positive patients treated with zoledronic acid were more likely to become dtc - negative following a 12 month treatment interval and concluded that treatment with zoledronic acid improved the elimination of dtcs .<br />the role of bisphosphonates in preventing skeletal metastases in patients with high risk early stage breast cancer is controversial [ 20,2327 ] .<br />the contribution of zoledronic acid in bone marrow recovery in this instance is not known .<br />breast cancer has a tendency to metastasize to the bone marrow , but does not commonly cause bone marrow failure .<br />the case presented describes a patient who developed complete bone marrow infiltration by estrogen receptor positive metastatic breast cancer that led to transfusion dependent pancytopenia .<br />the patient received treatment with continuous doxorubicin and zoledronic acid followed by endocrine therapy , which resulted in complete recovery of normal bone marrow function for 3 years .<br />drug therapy is a consideration in patients with bone marrow infiltration with good performance status .", "summary": "<pad> breast cancer has a tendency to metastasize to the bone marrow, but does not commonly cause bone marrow failure. the case presented describes a patient who developed complete bone marrow infiltration by estrogen receptor positive metastatic breast cancer that led to transfusion dependent pancytopenia. the patient received treatment with continuous doxorubicin and zoledronic acid followed by endocrine therapy, which resulted in complete recovery of normal bone marrow function for 3 years. drug therapy is a consideration in patients with bone marrow infiltration with good performance status."}, "article_6_bigbird_pegasus": {"source_doc": "disability has been assigned as the umbrella term to include impairments , activity limitations or participation restrictions by the international classification of functioning ( icf ) disability and health .<br />the older concept of  disability along with the terms  impairment and  handicap , as described by icf , have been subsumed under the concept of  activity and participation.<br />neuropsychiatric disorders continue to be leading contributors to the global burden of disease .<br />as per the world health report , 2001 mental illnesses accounted for 25% of total disability and 16% of the total burden .<br />among women aged 15 -

between group differences for the study variables for subjects with and without a family history of psychiatric illness<br />the current study aimed at assessing the profile of patients with schizophrenia seeking disability certification at a tertiary care multispecialty hospital in india .<br />additionally it aimed at assessing the various socio - demographic and illness related variables among these individuals .<br />the existing indian literature on disability among patients diagnosed with schizophrenia has focused on patients seeking treatment in out - patient , in - patient and community settings .<br />we analyzed a total of a total of 169 subjects seeking disability certification over the study period of 5 years was diagnosed with schizophrenia .<br />schizophrenia remains the most common diagnosis among previous indian studies on disability among treatment seeking psychiatric patients .<br />reported 65.3% of the subjects to be diagnosed with schizophrenia in their total sample of 285 over a 3 year period .<br />however , affective disorders have been found to be the most common cause of disability among not treatment seeking individuals in community based studies .<br />in spite of comparatively lower prevalence than other mental disorders schizophrenia continues to be over represented among treatment seekers in hospitals .<br />in the current study ,<br />an overwhelming majority of study subjects were male .<br />in a community based epidemiological survey for disability in rural karnataka ,<br />females constituted 68% of individuals with mental disability .<br />in a recent study from karnataka , females constituted 49.1% of all disability certificate seeking individuals over a 3 year period .<br />similarly , in a study among long stay patients diagnosed with schizophrenia 67.86% were male .<br />in another study from assam ,<br />31.6% of the study subjects were female .<br />while previous indian studies have reported relatively later help seeking for female patients suffering from schizophrenia , the same is not reflected in the findings of the current study .<br />in the present study male and female subjects did not differ significantly with regards to age at presentation , total duration of illness and duration since seeing treatment .<br />the study by kujur et al . also observed a significant difference in marital status of male and female patients with schizophrenia with majority ( 57.7% ) of women were separated from their husbands .<br />a significantly higher proportion of female subjects were divorced or separated in the current study .<br />previous studies from the west have documented moderate disability in most of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia irrespective of the setting .<br />in the current study<br />indian studies have revealed the disability among patients with schizophrenia to moderate to severe as early as 2 - 5 years after illness onset .<br />in a study from assam ,<br />64% of patients suffering from schizophrenia and 30% of those suffering from bipolar affective disorder had severe disability as per the ideas .<br />however , an indian study among non - treatment seeking individuals in a community setting found mild disability as the most common .<br />in the present study , the highest disability for both male and female subjects was observed in the work domain of ideas .<br />previous indian studies have also reported occupational disability as the most disabling of all the categories .<br />additionally , the least disability observed for personal care ( for both male and female subjects ) was also in keeping with similar observations in previous studies .<br />however , another indian study conducted in a mental hospital setting found the highest level of disability for understanding and communication domain of world health organisation disability assessment schedule ii ( whodas ii ) .<br />disability in schizophrenia has been found to be affected by characteristics like age of onset and duration of illness among other factors .<br />in a previous indian study from ranchi<br />it was found that duration of illness has a significant correlation with personal areas of disability and age of onset has significant positive correlation with personal and occupational area of disability .<br />however , in the current study a significant positive correlation between total duration of illness and global ideas score was observed only for the male subjects .<br />a previous study by thara et al . found a significantly higher global disability and occupational disability among male patients suffering from schizophrenia as compared to the female patients .<br />however , the two did not differ for disability on other domains including self - care , social withdrawal and social contact .<br />in the present<br />also the male and female subjects differed significantly only on the work domain of ideas .<br />no significant differences were observed for personal care , interpersonal interaction and understanding and communication domains .<br />also , there was no significant difference on the global ideas score for male and female subjects .<br />stigma , poor knowledge about the ideas , fear of misuse of certificates , discomfort to approach government hospitals , time constraints , rigid negative thinking about legal issues , denial of disability have been specified as some of reasons for underutilization of disability certification .<br />lack of education among disabled is an important barrier for effective delivery of services .<br />according to national sample survey organization , 2002<br />gender has been found to be an important determinant of help seeking for mental disorders .<br />women with common mental disorders were more likely to have sought some form of help than men in studies from western setting .<br />however , the situation is different in developing countries such as india .<br />due to socio - cultural factors women<br />researchers has revealed that those closest to the individual play an influential role in whether or not an individual seeks mental health services when experiencing distressing symptoms .<br />multi - ethnic studies have reported that asian patients with psychiatric illness tend to show the longest delay in help seeking .<br />more intensive , extended and persistent family involvement is a possible reason for the delay in seeking help by these individuals .<br />the present study offers some interesting and important insights in to disability certification seeking behavior of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia .<br />there is a relatively long gap between the onset of illness and disability certification .<br />in spite of regulatory threshold of 2 years ,<br />also , all the female subjects in the present study were not gainfully employed and were financially dependent on the family .<br />also , a significant greater proportion of them were either divorced or separated .<br />the findings also suggest a relatively early stabilisation of disability among females as the duration of illness was not found to be correlated with global ideas score .<br />however , there was a significant correlation between these two variables for male subjects .<br />relatively later impact of disorder on employment status is a likely possible reason for this observation .<br />lack of impact of presence of psychiatric illness in another family member does not impact the disability seeking behavior of the study subjects .<br />this is a worrisome finding and it reflects poor education of family with regard to the provisions of disability certification and disability benefits available .<br />there is a need to disseminate information related to impact on disabled , community mobilization , opportunity for education , opportunity for work , transfer skills to community level , program activities , and involvement of disabled people .<br />also , research with respect to services , fund allocation , cost - effectiveness , manpower , training , and technical aid of disabled people should be strengthened .<br />a special emphasis should be placed on providing rehabilitation services and disability benefits to the unreached persons with disabilities living in rural areas and small towns of the country .<br />positive impact of disability assessment camps on disability certification seeking behavior has been documented in india .<br />even those who have received disability certification do not utilize the disability benefits offered by the government .<br />the underutilization is even more prominent in rural areas with disability pension being the most utilized benefit .<br />we included all the subjects diagnosed with schizophrenia seeking disability certification over the study period .<br />assessment was carried out using a standardized indian instrument that has been used previously in indian settings .<br />however , there are certain limitations as well .<br />also , the findings need to be replicated in multisite studies before they could be generalized .<br />also , it would be informative to review these subjects over time to assess the stability of disability level .<br />additionally , information on the utilization of disability benefits subsequent to certification should also be assessed in future studies .<br />we included all the subjects diagnosed with schizophrenia seeking disability certification over the study period .<br />assessment was carried out using a standardized indian instrument that has been used previously in indian settings .<br />also , the findings need to be replicated in multisite studies before they could be generalized .<br />also , it would be informative to review these subjects over time to assess the stability of disability level .<br />additionally , information on the utilization of disability benefits subsequent to certification should also be assessed in future studies .<br />majority of patients with schizophrenia seeking disability certificate continue to be male .<br />however , male and female subjects tend to differ very little on various socio - demographic and illness related variables .<br />there are significant difference in the likely impact of schizophrenia on marital status of males and females .<br />however , the work related disability is relatively higher among males and females continue to be financially dependent on the family members .", "summary": "background : till recently there was no published literature on disability certification seeking behavior of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia. the current study aimed at understanding the profile of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia seeking disability certification for a tertiary level multispecialty hospital in india.materials and methods : the study was carried out at the psychiatry department for a tertiary care hospital in india. we here present the findings form review of cases seeking disability certification over a 5 year period.results:the study included a total of 285 cases. most ( 65.3% ) of the subjects were single, employed ( 100% ), with no dependents ( 62.1% ). the mean global disability score was 12.29 sd2.82 for male and 12.29 sd2.82 for female subjects. severe disability was observed in 34.8% of male subjects and 35.1% of female subjects. family history of psychiatric illness was positive in 78.1% of male subjects and 10.8% of female subjects. there was a significant correlation between total duration of illness and global disability score ( r=0.287, p=0.72 ). the most common cause of disability for both male and female subjects was from an urban setting.conclusions:disability is an important determinant for effective delivery of services. the most common diagnosis among previous indian studies were from urban areas. family history. family history of the family history of the family history.. .. the family history. ........ . ......... .......... ....... is a family.. .. is a family.."}, "article_6_human": {"source_doc": "disability has been assigned as the umbrella term to include impairments , activity limitations or participation restrictions by the international classification of functioning ( icf ) disability and health .<br />the older concept of  disability along with the terms  impairment and  handicap , as described by icf , have been subsumed under the concept of  activity and participation.<br />neuropsychiatric disorders continue to be leading contributors to the global burden of disease .<br />as per the world health report , 2001 mental illnesses accounted for 25% of total disability and 16% of the total burden .<br />among women aged 15 -

5 years after illness onset .<br />in a study from assam ,<br />64% of patients suffering from schizophrenia and 30% of those suffering from bipolar affective disorder had severe disability as per the ideas .<br />however , an indian study among non - treatment seeking individuals in a community setting found mild disability as the most common .<br />in the present study , the highest disability for both male and female subjects was observed in the work domain of ideas .<br />previous indian studies have also reported occupational disability as the most disabling of all the categories .<br />additionally , the least disability observed for personal care ( for both male and female subjects ) was also in keeping with similar observations in previous studies .<br />however , another indian study conducted in a mental hospital setting found the highest level of disability for understanding and communication domain of world health organisation disability assessment schedule ii ( whodas ii ) .<br />disability in schizophrenia has been found to be affected by characteristics like age of onset and duration of illness among other factors .<br />in a previous indian study from ranchi<br />it was found that duration of illness has a significant correlation with personal areas of disability and age of onset has significant positive correlation with personal and occupational area of disability .<br />however , in the current study a significant positive correlation between total duration of illness and global ideas score was observed only for the male subjects .<br />a previous study by thara et al . found a significantly higher global disability and occupational disability among male patients suffering from schizophrenia as compared to the female patients .<br />however , the two did not differ for disability on other domains including self -

cultural factors women<br />researchers has revealed that those closest to the individual play an influential role in whether or not an individual seeks mental health services when experiencing distressing symptoms .<br />multi - ethnic studies have reported that asian patients with psychiatric illness tend to show the longest delay in help seeking .<br />more intensive , extended and persistent family involvement is a possible reason for the delay in seeking help by these individuals .<br />the present study offers some interesting and important insights in to disability certification seeking behavior of patients diagnosed with schizophrenia .<br />there is a relatively long gap between the onset of illness and disability certification .<br />in spite of regulatory threshold of 2 years ,<br />also , all the female subjects in the present study were not gainfully employed and were financially dependent on the family .<br />also , a significant greater proportion of them were either divorced or separated .<br />the findings also suggest a relatively early stabilisation of disability among females as the duration of illness was not found to be correlated with global ideas score .<br />however , there was a significant correlation between these two variables for male subjects .<br />relatively later impact of disorder on employment status is a likely possible reason for this observation .<br />lack of impact of presence of psychiatric illness in another family member does not impact the disability seeking behavior of the study subjects .<br />this is a worrisome finding and it reflects poor education of family with regard to the provisions of disability certification and disability benefits available .<br />there is a need to disseminate information related to impact on disabled , community mobilization , opportunity for education , opportunity for work , transfer skills to community level , program activities , and involvement of disabled people .<br />also , research with respect to services , fund allocation , cost - effectiveness , manpower , training , and technical aid of disabled people should be strengthened .<br />a special emphasis should be placed on providing rehabilitation services and disability benefits to the unreached persons with disabilities living in rural areas and small towns of the country .<br />positive impact of disability assessment camps on disability certification seeking behavior has been documented in india .<br />even those who have received disability certification do not utilize the disability benefits offered by the government .<br />the underutilization is even more prominent in rural areas with disability pension being the most utilized benefit .<br />we included all the subjects diagnosed with schizophrenia seeking disability certification over the study period .<br />assessment was carried out using a standardized indian instrument that has been used previously in indian settings .<br />however , there are certain limitations as well .<br />also , the findings need to be replicated in multisite studies before they could be generalized .<br />also , it would be informative to review these subjects over time to assess the stability of disability level .<br />additionally , information on the utilization of disability benefits subsequent to certification should also be assessed in future studies .<br />we included all the subjects diagnosed with schizophrenia seeking disability certification over the study period .<br />assessment was carried out using a standardized indian instrument that has been used previously in indian settings .<br />also , the findings need to be replicated in multisite studies before they could be generalized .<br />also , it would be informative to review these subjects over time to assess the stability of disability level .<br />additionally , information on the utilization of disability benefits subsequent to certification should also be assessed in future studies .<br />majority of patients with schizophrenia seeking disability certificate continue to be male .<br />however , male and female subjects tend to differ very little on various socio -

coastal region .<br />the open - ended self - administered critical incident survey consisted of the following questions : ( 1 ) think of the last time you cared for an older adult driver in your practice .<br />what assessment strategies or parameters did you use to determine if the driver was safe or not ?<br />( 2 ) what strategies did you use to approach that driver about the issue of driving safety ?<br />( 3 ) how did you make the determination to intervene if you felt that the older adult was not safe to drive ?<br />permission was obtained through the institutional review board ( irb ) at an appropriate institution prior to initiating the study .<br />data analysis was performed using statistical package for the social sciences ( spss , version 20.0 ) to assess the demographic characteristics of respondents .<br />the narrative data obtained through the critical incident surveys was analyzed through an inductive classification process developed by flanagan .<br />the critical incidents were initially reviewed by an advanced practice nurse with a specialty in gerontology and an expert in using critical incident methodology to determine which incidents should be included in the analysis .<br />incidents that were judged to be nearly identical or very similar were grouped together to form subcategories of behaviors .<br />the incidents were resorted and discussed by the research team to refine and determine the final set of categories .<br />percentages of agreement between the researchers were calculated for each critical incident analysis .<br />as an estimate of the importance of each category ,<br />the number of incidents sorted by the researchers was counted and placed into a hierarchical structure or taxonomy that identified categories and their related frequencies .<br />a total of 21 nurse practitioners in the southeast region of the united states ( us ) participated in this study .<br />the predominantly female sample ( n = 20 , 95% ) had a mean age of 48.3 years ( sd 11.3 years ; range 2968 years ) .<br />the average length of employment as a nurse practitioner was 9.1 years ( sd 8.4 years ) .<br />the majority of the participants earned master 's degree ( n = 18 , 85.7% ) .<br />one held bachelor 's degree with a family nurse practitioner certificate , one had a doctorate of nursing practice ( dnp ) , and one received ph.d .<br />approximately one - half of the participants ( 47.6% ) achieved specialty certifications reflecting widely varied areas of advanced nursing practice including : adult , geriatrics , psychiatric mental health , diabetes , oncology , hospice , and wound , ostomy , and continence nursing .<br />none of the study participants had reported attendance at a continuing education program on dealing with older drivers .<br />ninety - five percent ( n = 20 ) reported that they see older adults ( > 65 years ) who are still driving at least once a week or more often in clinical practice settings .<br />when asked what age they usually start screening for driving ability , 76% ( n = 16 ) indicated that there was no specific age level .<br />two participants ( 10% ) reported initiating driver 's safety screening between the ages of 50 and 65 years , while three ( n = 14% ) began screening at the age of 66 years and above .<br />ninety percent ( n = 19 ) involved family members in discussions about driving safety .<br />six categories of driver behavior prompted nps to consider performing an evaluation for driving safety .<br />examples of the circumstances that trigger an assessment of driving capabilities are presented in table 1 .<br />the participants ' self - rating of competence in assessing older driver 's safety reflected a moderate level of success at 6.6 ( sd 1.3 , 110 scale with 1 very poor and 10 excellent ) .<br />self - ratings of comfort in approaching older adults about their driving safety were higher at 8.0 ( sd 2.3 , 110 scale ) .<br />a total of 89 incidents described strategies that nurse practitioners used in assessing an older driver 's safety .<br />when the incidents were analyzed , 11 major categories emerged with an interrater agreement of 95% .<br />a listing of assessment categories and circumstances that trigger an assessment of driving capabilities is presented in table 1 .<br />the largest category , assessing diminished short - term memory , forgetfulness , or dementia , accounted for 30 incidents ( 34% ) .<br />the use of the mental status exam or the montreal cognitive assessment ( moca ) was mentioned most frequently .<br />nurse practitioners shared the following:i ask them about how many times they are getting lost [ while driving ] .<br />i also ask them how many times do you  beep ' your horn at other people , and how many times do other people beep their horns at you ?<br />that 's a big red flag to me .<br />if they ca n't tell me how they drove here from their house , that 's another red flag.i had one patient whose daughter mentioned a concern about driving .<br />i asked her [ the patient ] to draw a clock [ i used the clock drawing test to assess cognition ] and this was really abnormal even though the geriatrician had just done a mental status exam 8 months prior .<br />there was a significant change.i [ conducted a ] mental status exam .<br />the trigger for me was having to repeat the same conversation over and over again to a patient who was asking the same questions over and over again , day to day , and week to week .<br />i ask them about how many times they are getting lost [ while driving ] .<br />i also ask them how many times do you  beep ' your horn at other people , and how many times do other people beep their horns at you ?<br />that 's a big red flag to me .<br />if they ca n't tell me how they drove here from their house , that 's another red flag .<br />i asked her [ the patient ] to draw a clock [ i used the clock drawing test to assess cognition ] and this was really abnormal even though the geriatrician had just done a mental status exam 8 months prior .<br />there was a significant change .<br />the trigger for me was having to repeat the same conversation over and over again to a patient who was asking the same questions over and over again , day to day , and week to week .<br />the second largest category , identifying physical frailty , included 21 or 55% of the incidents ( n = 21 ) .<br />specific elements included  conducting a fall assessment ,   assessing [ the patient 's ] ability to turn from side to side , including limited range of motion in the neck ,  <br /> how well they can feel their feet ,  and  assessing whether or not the patient is able to use the dominate foot to control the pedals of the car .<br />participants added the following.i assess their physical ability on walking by  watching them walk in ' [ to the office ] and also look at their ability to get up on the exam table and also their balance.i<br />[ look for ] patients who describe a poor balance and i assess vertigo or syncope .<br />i also look for people who are losing visual field related to macular degeneration or other visual changes .<br />most people with this are already limiting their own driving.i observe my patients getting out of and then back into their car .<br />i assess their physical ability on walking by  watching them walk in ' [ to the office ] and also look at their ability to get up on the exam table and also their balance .<br />i [ look for ] patients who describe a poor balance and i assess vertigo or syncope .<br />i also look for people who are losing visual field related to macular degeneration or other visual changes .<br />i observe their gait , walking , balance , flexibility , and overall mobility .<br />behavioral incidents in the third largest category , assessing changes in sensory impairment ,<br />i ask every patient when they had a last eye exam and will [ evaluate their vision ] with the snellen chart .<br />if a person can not seem to hear me in a normal conversation , i 'll check their ears for impaction and the whisper test .<br />a fourth category , obtaining collateral information from family members , accounted for 11% ( n = 10 ) of the total number of incidents .<br />as one participant stated that  a trigger is when an adult child makes a comment such as  i wo n't ride with him ' or that they will not allow their grandchildren to ride with the patient .<br />a fifth category , assessing for impulsivity / lack of judgment , accounted for 6% ( n = 5 ) of the total number of incidents , while a sixth category contained incidents that described evaluating medications for drowsiness side - effects ( n = 3 , 3% ) .<br />to a far lesser extent , nurse practitioners described retrieving a self - report of impaired driving or motor vehicle accident ( n = 2 , 2% ) , evaluating symptoms of new onset neurologic disease ( n = 2 , 2% ) , assessing changes in functional status ( n = 2 , 2% ) , assessing history of drugs and/or alcohol abuse ( n = 1 , 1% ) , and evaluating postmyocardial infarction status ( n = 1 , 1% ) .<br />the two most common strategies were using therapeutic communication to initiate a nonthreatening conversation about driving safety and expressing concern for the older adult 's driving safely .<br />a total of 66 critical incidents were reported which described strategies that nurse practitioners use in practice to increase safety in older adults .<br />when the incidents were analyzed , nine categories of behaviors were determined with an interrater agreement of 100% .<br />categories included the following : involving family members , using therapeutic communication , referring patient to occupational / physical therapy , conducting a vision examination , using a step approach to driving termination , using objective data , referring patient to the department of motor vehicles , referring patient to a medical specialist , and limiting medications on the beers list .<br />one study has shown that clinicians and older adult drivers are open to the idea of using a tiered approach to driving assessment in the older adult .<br />the largest category , involving family members , accounted for 24% ( n = 16 ) of the incidents .<br />as one nurse practitioner stated the following.bring the family into it .<br />ultimately , they are the ones to take the keys if the patient is resistant.others added the following .<br />sometimes i will voice safety concerns that have been brought up by the family .<br />if the family is present , i try to talk to them and coach them to do the right thing like take the keys or put the care in another place.i tell families to stop being the caregiver and go back to being a family member and make me the  bad guy ' .<br />i do n't want to ride with you ' and that is a pretty strong message.it's important to work with families and ask them ,<br />why are you letting the most unable person in the room drive down the street ? '<br />it usually has to do with the way this family has made decisions in the past as well as cultural issues , and family dynamics .<br />when i brought up the situation to the family , they agreed and the patient stopped driving until his medical situation improved .<br />he 's doing a lot better now.the second largest category involved the use of therapeutic communication strategies ( n = 14 , 21% ) .<br />one participant stated  ask the older adult about how they feel about their ability to drive .<br />i show empathy toward him and his loss of independence and having to rely on family for transportation ,  and  i try to be honest about safety concerns.i used therapeutic communication .<br />i told him the concerns such as him not being able to recall the names of the roads that he just drove on to get here.i talked to her conversationally about how she 's been doing and how her family has been doing .<br />i started asking about driving when i asked her about her vision and eye glasses .<br />this made her feel comfortable first so then i asked about this [ the driving ] .<br />bring the family into it .<br />ultimately , they are the ones to take the keys if the patient is resistant .<br />sometimes i will voice safety concerns that have been brought up by the family .<br />if the family is present , i try to talk to them and coach them to do the right thing like take the keys or put the care in another place .<br />i tell families to stop being the caregiver and go back to being a family member and make me the  bad guy ' .<br />i do n't want to ride with you ' and that is a pretty strong message .<br />it 's important to work with families and ask them ,  why are you letting the most unable person in the room drive down the street ?

risk medications with older adult drivers .<br />when participants ( nurse practitioners ) were asked to list perceived barriers for driving cessation , the most frequently mentioned barriers included resistance from the patient with denial , lack of alternative transportation , spousal denial , and increased isolation .<br />a listing of the most frequent barriers that nurse practitioners face in working with older adult drivers is presented in table 4 .<br />the participants in this study closely represent the national np demographics .<br />compared to the 2012 national aanp sample survey ,<br />the demographics of nps nationally were a mean age of 51 years , white ( 85.4% ) , black / african american ( 3% ) , female ( 9.4% ) , having a graduate level degree ( 97.2% ) , and having practiced as a np for 11 years .<br />this study identified strategies used by nps in the assessment and intervention of older adults in one geographical region .<br />obvious limitations of this study are the limitation to one geographical area .<br />to the author 's knowledge , this is one of the first studies to examine self - report behaviors and strategies of nps on this topic .<br />clinical practice for assessing and intervening with older adult drivers varies significantly from provider to provider .<br />nps are educated to practice holistically and place great importance on building rapport and trust with their patients and their families .<br />this trusting relationship will prove beneficial when a difficult conversation such as driving cessation is needed .<br />impaired cognition was the most common reason a np determined a need to intervene . assessing cognitive status , physical frailty , and sensory impairments were the most common physical exam strategies used .<br />obtaining collateral information from family members ranked just below obtaining physical exam or objective data .<br />using therapeutic communication techniques and a concern of safety for the older adult were the most common strategies used in approaching the older adult about driving .<br />nps ranked the most helpful intervention was to involve family members and the least helpful intervention was the lack of family guidance from the provider . dealing with patient concerns about lack of transportation , especially in rural areas , and resistance to driving termination were the two most common perceived barriers .<br />the wide variation in ways which nps make the determination to address driving in older adults and the lack of consistent guidelines for dealing with this issue should be noted .<br />as the supply of primary care physicians is expected to decrease , the number of nurse practitioners ( nps ) is expected to increase 94% between 2008 and 2025 .<br />nps are trained to provide a holistic approach to patient care and approximately half of all nps practice in the primary care setting .<br />standardized curriculum for nurse practitioner students does not require faculty to address concerns of older adult drivers ; therefore , few nps graduate with this training .<br />this could be due to lack of clinical guidelines , and faculty are unclear as to what should be taught .<br />as this is a public safety concern<br />having difficult conversations with older adults such as driving cessation is time consuming and possibly threatens the patient - provider relationship .<br />there is a need for the development of clinical guidelines that nps can use efficiently during a routine office visit .<br />nps feel comfortable using evidenced - based clinical guidelines to guide their clinical practice with common chronic disease management .<br />development of an evidenced - based clinical guideline for assessment and intervention with older adult drivers would be used similarly .<br />our social work and occupational therapist colleagues have been working on this issue for quite some time .<br />occupational therapists have developed guidelines for them to use in assessment of older adult drivers .<br />nps and np students should also be aware of community resources available in their areas of clinical practice .<br />simply making themselves aware of resources available to them and the older adult , such as the online aarp driver safety program that can be found at http://www.aarp.org/home-garden/transportation/driver_safety/   would prove beneficial .<br />this study shows the varied and inconsistent clinical practice of nps assessing and intervening with older adults drivers . who is to say that one strategy is better than the other ?<br />it is clear that nps value the relationship they have with their patients and they value the need to intervene when public safety is at risk .<br />development of evidenced - based clinical guidelines would prove beneficial for nps to use in clinical practice , as long as the guidelines were able to be used quickly and efficiently .", "summary": "background. assessment of driving capability in the older adult is becoming an essential aspect of the comprehensive geriatric exam, even though many primary care providers ( pcps ) do not view themselves as experts in this area. the nurse practitioner ( np ) has a duty to routinely assess and intervene when caring for older adult drivers. methods. this study was designed as a descriptive, exploratory, and mixed methods research. data were collected through face -

coastal region .<br />the open - ended self - administered critical incident survey consisted of the following questions : ( 1 ) think of the last time you cared for an older adult driver in your practice .<br />what assessment strategies or parameters did you use to determine if the driver was safe or not ?<br />( 2 ) what strategies did you use to approach that driver about the issue of driving safety ?<br />( 3 ) how did you make the determination to intervene if you felt that the older adult was not safe to drive ?<br />permission was obtained through the institutional review board ( irb ) at an appropriate institution prior to initiating the study .<br />data analysis was performed using statistical package for the social sciences ( spss , version 20.0 ) to assess the demographic characteristics of respondents .<br />the narrative data obtained through the critical incident surveys was analyzed through an inductive classification process developed by flanagan .<br />the critical incidents were initially reviewed by an advanced practice nurse with a specialty in gerontology and an expert in using critical incident methodology to determine which incidents should be included in the analysis .<br />incidents that were judged to be nearly identical or very similar were grouped together to form subcategories of behaviors .<br />the incidents were resorted and discussed by the research team to refine and determine the final set of categories .<br />percentages of agreement between the researchers were calculated for each critical incident analysis .<br />as an estimate of the importance of each category ,<br />the number of incidents sorted by the researchers was counted and placed into a hierarchical structure or taxonomy that identified categories and their related frequencies .<br />a total of 21 nurse practitioners in the southeast region of the united states ( us ) participated in this study .<br />the predominantly female sample ( n = 20 , 95% ) had a mean age of 48.3 years ( sd 11.3 years ; range 2968 years ) .<br />the average length of employment as a nurse practitioner was 9.1 years ( sd 8.4 years ) .<br />the majority of the participants earned master 's degree ( n = 18 , 85.7% ) .<br />one held bachelor 's degree with a family nurse practitioner certificate , one had a doctorate of nursing practice ( dnp ) , and one received ph.d .<br />approximately one - half of the participants ( 47.6% ) achieved specialty certifications reflecting widely varied areas of advanced nursing practice including : adult , geriatrics , psychiatric mental health , diabetes , oncology , hospice , and wound , ostomy , and continence nursing .<br />none of the study participants had reported attendance at a continuing education program on dealing with older drivers .<br />ninety - five percent ( n = 20 ) reported that they see older adults ( > 65 years ) who are still driving at least once a week or more often in clinical practice settings .<br />when asked what age they usually start screening for driving ability , 76% ( n = 16 ) indicated that there was no specific age level .<br />two participants ( 10% ) reported initiating driver 's safety screening between the ages of 50 and 65 years , while three ( n = 14% ) began screening at the age of 66 years and above .<br />ninety percent ( n = 19 ) involved family members in discussions about driving safety .<br />six categories of driver behavior prompted nps to consider performing an evaluation for driving safety .<br />examples of the circumstances that trigger an assessment of driving capabilities are presented in table 1 .<br />the participants ' self - rating of competence in assessing older driver 's safety reflected a moderate level of success at 6.6 ( sd 1.3 , 110 scale with 1 very poor and 10 excellent ) .<br />self - ratings of comfort in approaching older adults about their driving safety were higher at 8.0 ( sd 2.3 , 110 scale ) .<br />a total of 89 incidents described strategies that nurse practitioners used in assessing an older driver 's safety .<br />when the incidents were analyzed , 11 major categories emerged with an interrater agreement of 95% .<br />a listing of assessment categories and circumstances that trigger an assessment of driving capabilities is presented in table 1 .<br />the largest category , assessing diminished short - term memory , forgetfulness , or dementia , accounted for 30 incidents ( 34% ) .<br />the use of the mental status exam or the montreal cognitive assessment ( moca ) was mentioned most frequently .<br />nurse practitioners shared the following:i ask them about how many times they are getting lost [ while driving ] .<br />i also ask them how many times do you  beep ' your horn at other people , and how many times do other people beep their horns at you ?<br />that 's a big red flag to me .<br />if they ca n't tell me how they drove here from their house , that 's another red flag.i had one patient whose daughter mentioned a concern about driving .<br />i asked her [ the patient ] to draw a clock [ i used the clock drawing test to assess cognition ] and this was really abnormal even though the geriatrician had just done a mental status exam 8 months prior .<br />there was a significant change.i [ conducted a ] mental status exam .<br />the trigger for me was having to repeat the same conversation over and over again to a patient who was asking the same questions over and over again , day to day , and week to week .<br />i ask them about how many times they are getting lost [ while driving ] .<br />i also ask them how many times do you  beep ' your horn at other people , and how many times do other people beep their horns at you ?<br />that 's a big red flag to me .<br />if they ca n't tell me how they drove here from their house , that 's another red flag .<br />i asked her [ the patient ] to draw a clock [ i used the clock drawing test to assess cognition ] and this was really abnormal even though the geriatrician had just done a mental status exam 8 months prior .<br />there was a significant change .<br />the trigger for me was having to repeat the same conversation over and over again to a patient who was asking the same questions over and over again , day to day , and week to week .<br />the second largest category , identifying physical frailty , included 21 or 55% of the incidents ( n = 21 ) .<br />specific elements included  conducting a fall assessment ,   assessing [ the patient 's ] ability to turn from side to side , including limited range of motion in the neck ,  <br /> how well they can feel their feet ,  and  assessing whether or not the patient is able to use the dominate foot to control the pedals of the car .<br />participants added the following.i assess their physical ability on walking by  watching them walk in ' [ to the office ] and also look at their ability to get up on the exam table and also their balance.i<br />[ look for ] patients who describe a poor balance and i assess vertigo or syncope .<br />i also look for people who are losing visual field related to macular degeneration or other visual changes .<br />most people with this are already limiting their own driving.i observe my patients getting out of and then back into their car .<br />i assess their physical ability on walking by  watching them walk in ' [ to the office ] and also look at their ability to get up on the exam table and also their balance .<br />i [ look for ] patients who describe a poor balance and i assess vertigo or syncope .<br />i also look for people who are losing visual field related to macular degeneration or other visual changes .<br />i observe their gait , walking , balance , flexibility , and overall mobility .<br />behavioral incidents in the third largest category , assessing changes in sensory impairment ,<br />i ask every patient when they had a last eye exam and will [ evaluate their vision ] with the snellen chart .<br />if a person can not seem to hear me in a normal conversation , i 'll check their ears for impaction and the whisper test .<br />a fourth category , obtaining collateral information from family members , accounted for 11% ( n = 10 ) of the total number of incidents .<br />as one participant stated that  a trigger is when an adult child makes a comment such as  i wo n't ride with him ' or that they will not allow their grandchildren to ride with the patient .<br />a fifth category , assessing for impulsivity / lack of judgment , accounted for 6% ( n = 5 ) of the total number of incidents , while a sixth category contained incidents that described evaluating medications for drowsiness side - effects ( n = 3 , 3% ) .<br />to a far lesser extent , nurse practitioners described retrieving a self - report of impaired driving or motor vehicle accident ( n = 2 , 2% ) , evaluating symptoms of new onset neurologic disease ( n = 2 , 2% ) , assessing changes in functional status ( n = 2 , 2% ) , assessing history of drugs and/or alcohol abuse ( n = 1 , 1% ) , and evaluating postmyocardial infarction status ( n = 1 , 1% ) .<br />the two most common strategies were using therapeutic communication to initiate a nonthreatening conversation about driving safety and expressing concern for the older adult 's driving safely .<br />a total of 66 critical incidents were reported which described strategies that nurse practitioners use in practice to increase safety in older adults .<br />when the incidents were analyzed , nine categories of behaviors were determined with an interrater agreement of 100% .<br />categories included the following : involving family members , using therapeutic communication , referring patient to occupational / physical therapy , conducting a vision examination , using a step approach to driving termination , using objective data , referring patient to the department of motor vehicles , referring patient to a medical specialist , and limiting medications on the beers list .<br />one study has shown that clinicians and older adult drivers are open to the idea of using a tiered approach to driving assessment in the older adult .<br />the largest category , involving family members , accounted for 24% ( n = 16 ) of the incidents .<br />as one nurse practitioner stated the following.bring the family into it .<br />ultimately , they are the ones to take the keys if the patient is resistant.others added the following .<br />sometimes i will voice safety concerns that have been brought up by the family .<br />if the family is present , i try to talk to them and coach them to do the right thing like take the keys or put the care in another place.i tell families to stop being the caregiver and go back to being a family member and make me the  bad guy ' .<br />i do n't want to ride with you ' and that is a pretty strong message.it's important to work with families and ask them ,<br />why are you letting the most unable person in the room drive down the street ? '<br />it usually has to do with the way this family has made decisions in the past as well as cultural issues , and family dynamics .<br />when i brought up the situation to the family , they agreed and the patient stopped driving until his medical situation improved .<br />he 's doing a lot better now.the second largest category involved the use of therapeutic communication strategies ( n = 14 , 21% ) .<br />one participant stated  ask the older adult about how they feel about their ability to drive .<br />i show empathy toward him and his loss of independence and having to rely on family for transportation ,  and  i try to be honest about safety concerns.i used therapeutic communication .<br />i told him the concerns such as him not being able to recall the names of the roads that he just drove on to get here.i talked to her conversationally about how she 's been doing and how her family has been doing .<br />i started asking about driving when i asked her about her vision and eye glasses .<br />this made her feel comfortable first so then i asked about this [ the driving ] .<br />bring the family into it .<br />ultimately , they are the ones to take the keys if the patient is resistant .<br />sometimes i will voice safety concerns that have been brought up by the family .<br />if the family is present , i try to talk to them and coach them to do the right thing like take the keys or put the care in another place .<br />i tell families to stop being the caregiver and go back to being a family member and make me the  bad guy ' .<br />i do n't want to ride with you ' and that is a pretty strong message .<br />it 's important to work with families and ask them ,  why are you letting the most unable person in the room drive down the street ? '<br />it usually has to do with the way this family has made decisions in the past as well as cultural issues , and family dynamics .<br />when i brought up the situation to the family , they agreed and the patient stopped driving until his medical situation improved .<br />i show empathy toward him and his loss of independence and having to rely on family for transportation ,  and  i try to be honest about safety concerns .<br />i told him the concerns such as him not being able to recall the names of the roads that he just drove on to get here .<br />i talked to her conversationally about how she 's been doing and how her family has been doing .<br />i started asking about driving when i asked her about her vision and eye glasses .<br />this made her feel comfortable first so then i asked about this [ the driving ] .<br />a third largest category contained incidents that described incidents where the nurse practitioner referred the patient to occupational or physical therapy ( n = 10 , 15% ) , while 12% ( n = 8) involved conducting a vision screening examination .<br />eleven percent of the incidents ( n = 7 ) described using a step approach to driving termination .<br />first thing is to eliminate driving at night and then i try to find out what 's the most important thing they want to drive to .<br />i have one patient who only wants to drive 2 miles from his home to the gas station where he goes into buy his coffee and newspaper and then he drives home .<br />for the longest time<br />this is the only driving he would do and then came the day when i did n't feel he was safe to do that anymore<br />and we had him stop driving<br />i do n't think you can just take it all away from them unless it 's really imminent that they are going to hurt themselves.work with patient to drive only at certain times of the day and to certain areas that are familiar .<br />i had one patient who had very slow response times so we placed a restriction that he could only drive on certain roads and stay off main roads .<br />first thing is to eliminate driving at night and then i try to find out what 's the most important thing they want to drive to .<br />i have one patient who only wants to drive 2 miles from his home to the gas station where he goes into buy his coffee and newspaper and then he drives home .<br />for the longest time<br />this is the only driving he would do and then came the day when i did n't feel he was safe to do that anymore<br />and we had him stop driving<br />i do n't think you can just take it all away from them unless it 's really imminent that they are going to hurt themselves .<br />work with patient to drive only at certain times of the day and to certain areas that are familiar .<br />i had one patient who had very slow response times so we placed a restriction that he could only drive on certain roads and stay off main roads .<br />additional categories reflected the importance of using objective data when discussing driving safety with older adults ( n = 5 , 7% ) and referring the patient to the department of motor vehicles ( n = 3 , 5% ) .<br />two incidents ( 3% ) described referring the patient to a medical specialist , while one incident ( 2% ) described the importance of avoiding the use of inappropriate , high - risk medications with older adult drivers .<br />when participants ( nurse practitioners ) were asked to list perceived barriers for driving cessation , the most frequently mentioned barriers included resistance from the patient with denial , lack of alternative transportation , spousal denial , and increased isolation .<br />a listing of the most frequent barriers that nurse practitioners face in working with older adult drivers is presented in table 4 .<br />the participants in this study closely represent the national np demographics .<br />compared to the 2012 national aanp sample survey ,<br />the demographics of nps nationally were a mean age of 51 years , white ( 85.4% ) , black / african american ( 3% ) , female ( 9.4% ) , having a graduate level degree ( 97.2% ) , and having practiced as a np for 11 years .<br />this study identified strategies used by nps in the assessment and intervention of older adults in one geographical region .<br />obvious limitations of this study are the limitation to one geographical area .<br />to the author 's knowledge , this is one of the first studies to examine self - report behaviors and strategies of nps on this topic .<br />clinical practice for assessing and intervening with older adult drivers varies significantly from provider to provider .<br />nps are educated to practice holistically and place great importance on building rapport and trust with their patients and their families .<br />this trusting relationship will prove beneficial when a difficult conversation such as driving cessation is needed .<br />impaired cognition was the most common reason a np determined a need to intervene . assessing cognitive status , physical frailty , and sensory impairments were the most common physical exam strategies used .<br />obtaining collateral information from family members ranked just below obtaining physical exam or objective data .<br />using therapeutic communication techniques and a concern of safety for the older adult were the most common strategies used in approaching the older adult about driving .<br />nps ranked the most helpful intervention was to involve family members and the least helpful intervention was the lack of family guidance from the provider . dealing with patient concerns about lack of transportation , especially in rural areas , and resistance to driving termination were the two most common perceived barriers .<br />the wide variation in ways which nps make the determination to address driving in older adults and the lack of consistent guidelines for dealing with this issue should be noted .<br />as the supply of primary care physicians is expected to decrease , the number of nurse practitioners ( nps ) is expected to increase 94% between 2008 and 2025 .<br />nps are trained to provide a holistic approach to patient care and approximately half of all nps practice in the primary care setting .<br />standardized curriculum for nurse practitioner students does not require faculty to address concerns of older adult drivers ; therefore , few nps graduate with this training .<br />this could be due to lack of clinical guidelines , and faculty are unclear as to what should be taught .<br />as this is a public safety concern<br />having difficult conversations with older adults such as driving cessation is time consuming and possibly threatens the patient - provider relationship .<br />there is a need for the development of clinical guidelines that nps can use efficiently during a routine office visit .<br />nps feel comfortable using evidenced - based clinical guidelines to guide their clinical practice with common chronic disease management .<br />development of an evidenced - based clinical guideline for assessment and intervention with older adult drivers would be used similarly .<br />our social work and occupational therapist colleagues have been working on this issue for quite some time .<br />occupational therapists have developed guidelines for them to use in assessment of older adult drivers .<br />nps and np students should also be aware of community resources available in their areas of clinical practice .<br />simply making themselves aware of resources available to them and the older adult , such as the online aarp driver safety program that can be found at http://www.aarp.org/home-garden/transportation/driver_safety/   would prove beneficial .<br />this study shows the varied and inconsistent clinical practice of nps assessing and intervening with older adults drivers . who is to say that one strategy is better than the other ?<br />it is clear that nps value the relationship they have with their patients and they value the need to intervene when public safety is at risk .<br />development of evidenced - based clinical guidelines would prove beneficial for nps to use in clinical practice , as long as the guidelines were able to be used quickly and efficiently .", "summary": "as the silver tsunami continues , assessing and intervening with older adult drivers are becoming an essential aspect of the comprehensive geriatric exam . the current lack of time efficient clinical guidelines is a concern and barrier for nps . the purpose of this study was to identify strategies currently used by nps . the critical incident technique was used to obtain data from a convenience sample of nps . a total of 89 incidents were collected . the perspective of the np can provide important information for developing clinical guidelines to promote individual and community safety ."}, "article_7_longt5": {"source_doc": "as the silver tsunami continues through the us and globally , the number of drivers over the age of 75 will increase significantly .<br />as of 2012 , there were 36 million older americans licensed to drive , which was a 34% increase from 1999 .<br />accidents or unintentional injuries are the 7th leading cause of death in persons 65 and older and are often the result of impairment .<br />in the 64 to 75 age group ,<br />injuries from motor vehicle accidents ( mvas ) are the leading cause of injury related death and the second leading cause in the 75 to 84 age group .<br />drivers who are 80 years old and older have 9 times greater fatality rate than drivers aged 25 to 69 .<br />assessment of driving capability in the older adult is becoming an essential aspect of the comprehensive geriatric exam , even though many primary care providers ( pcps ) do not view themselves as experts in this area and may defer driving assessment and capability to the local department of motor vehicles ( dmv ) office .<br />however , a survey conducted by the american association of retired persons ( aarp ) showed that 40% of people surveyed aged 50 and older believed that their pcp  could best determine their ability to drive safely  [ 5 , p. 92 ] .<br />earlier assessment and intervention lead to prolonged health maintenance and independence , which is an essential aspect that the pcp must consider for the older adult driver .<br />according to the american association of nurse practitioners ( aanp ) ( 2012 ) , 80% of nurse practitioners ( nps ) practice in a primary care setting .<br />currently , there are three np graduates to every one primary care physician graduate in the united states ( us ) , and nps are improving access to care , especially in rural areas where alternative transportation methods may not be available .<br />driver safety is considered a public and personal safety issue and the np has a duty to routinely assess and intervene when appropriate .<br />variations across state laws and regulations regarding drivers make it challenging to have a nationally accepted clinical guideline or standard of care specific to assessment of safe driving .<br />driving regulations , laws , and reporting policies vary according to state and many providers are not fully aware of these laws and policies within the state where they practice .<br />in one state , a healthcare provider can be sued for alerting the dmv of a person 's medical diagnosis , whereas , in another state , the healthcare provider is negligible if they do not report it .<br />these extremes in variability make it confusing and difficult for nps to know what to do and what to follow .<br />report a lack of specific guidelines for primary care providers to use when caring for an older adult driver in the office setting .<br />nps caring for older adults do not have an efficient evidenced -

rating of competence in assessing older driver 's safety reflected a moderate level of success at 6.6 ( sd 1.3 , 110 scale with 1 very poor and 10 excellent ) .<br />self - ratings of comfort in approaching older adults about their driving safety were higher at 8.0 ( sd 2.3 , 110 scale ) .<br />a total of 89 incidents described strategies that nurse practitioners used in assessing an older driver 's safety .<br />when the incidents were analyzed , 11 major categories emerged with an interrater agreement of 95% .<br />a listing of assessment categories and circumstances that trigger an assessment of driving capabilities is presented in table 1 .<br />the largest category , assessing diminished short - term memory , forgetfulness , or dementia , accounted for 30 incidents ( 34% ) .<br />the use of the mental status exam or the montreal cognitive assessment ( moca ) was mentioned most frequently .<br />nurse practitioners shared the following:i ask them about how many times they are getting lost [ while driving ] .<br />i also ask them how many times do you  beep ' your horn at other people , and how many times do other people beep their horns at you ?<br />that 's a big red flag to me .<br />if they ca n't tell me how they drove here from their house , that 's another red flag.i had one patient whose daughter mentioned a concern about driving .<br />i asked her [ the patient ] to draw a clock [ i used the clock drawing test to assess cognition ] and this was really abnormal even though the geriatrician had just done a mental status exam 8 months prior .<br />there was a significant change.i [ conducted a ] mental status exam .<br />the trigger for me was having to repeat the same conversation over and over again to a patient who was asking the same questions over and over again , day to day , and week to week .<br />i ask them about how many times they are getting lost [ while driving ] .<br />i also ask them how many times do you  beep ' your horn at other people , and how many times do other people beep their horns at you ?<br />that 's a big red flag to me .<br />if they ca n't tell me how they drove here from their house , that 's another red flag .<br />i asked her [ the patient ] to draw a clock [ i used the clock drawing test to assess cognition ] and this was really abnormal even though the geriatrician had just done a mental status exam 8 months prior .<br />there was a significant change .<br />the trigger for me was having to repeat the same conversation over and over again to a patient who was asking the same questions over and over again , day to day , and week to week .<br />the second largest category , identifying physical frailty , included 21 or 55% of the incidents ( n = 21 ) .<br />specific elements included  conducting a fall assessment ,   assessing [ the patient 's ] ability to turn from side to side , including limited range of motion in the neck ,  <br /> how well they can feel their feet ,  and  assessing whether or not the patient is able to use the dominate foot to control the pedals of the car .<br />participants added the following.i assess their physical ability on walking by  watching them walk in ' [ to the office ] and also look at their ability to get up on the exam table and also their balance.i<br />[ look for ] patients who describe a poor balance and i assess vertigo or syncope .<br />i also look for people who are losing visual field related to macular degeneration or other visual changes .<br />most people with this are already limiting their own driving.i observe my patients getting out of and then back into their car .<br />i assess their physical ability on walking by  watching them walk in ' [ to the office ] and also look at their ability to get up on the exam table and also their balance .<br />i [ look for ] patients who describe a poor balance and i assess vertigo or syncope .<br />i also look for people who are losing visual field related to macular degeneration or other visual changes .<br />i observe their gait , walking , balance , flexibility , and overall mobility .<br />behavioral incidents in the third largest category , assessing changes in sensory impairment ,<br />i ask every patient when they had a last eye exam and will [ evaluate their vision ] with the snellen chart .<br />if a person can not seem to hear me in a normal conversation , i 'll check their ears for impaction and the whisper test .<br />a fourth category , obtaining collateral information from family members , accounted for 11% ( n = 10 ) of the total number of incidents .<br />as one participant stated that  a trigger is when an adult child makes a comment such as  i wo n't ride with him ' or that they will not allow their grandchildren to ride with the patient .<br />a fifth category , assessing for impulsivity / lack of judgment , accounted for 6% ( n = 5 ) of the total number of incidents , while a sixth category contained incidents that described evaluating medications for drowsiness side - effects ( n = 3 , 3% ) .<br />to a far lesser extent , nurse practitioners described retrieving a self - report of impaired driving or motor vehicle accident ( n = 2 , 2% ) , evaluating symptoms of new onset neurologic disease ( n = 2 , 2% ) , assessing changes in functional status ( n = 2 , 2% ) , assessing history of drugs and/or alcohol abuse ( n = 1 , 1% ) , and evaluating postmyocardial infarction status ( n = 1 , 1% ) .<br />the two most common strategies were using therapeutic communication to initiate a nonthreatening conversation about driving safety and expressing concern for the older adult 's driving safely .<br />a total of 66 critical incidents were reported which described strategies that nurse practitioners use in practice to increase safety in older adults .<br />when the incidents were analyzed , nine categories of behaviors were determined with an interrater agreement of 100% .<br />categories included the following : involving family members , using therapeutic communication , referring patient to occupational / physical therapy , conducting a vision examination , using a step approach to driving termination , using objective data , referring patient to the department of motor vehicles , referring patient to a medical specialist , and limiting medications on the beers list .<br />one study has shown that clinicians and older adult drivers are open to the idea of using a tiered approach to driving assessment in the older adult .<br />the largest category , involving family members , accounted for 24% ( n = 16 ) of the incidents .<br />as one nurse practitioner stated the following.bring the family into it .<br />ultimately , they are the ones to take the keys if the patient is resistant.others added the following .<br />sometimes i will voice safety concerns that have been brought up by the family .<br />if the family is present , i try to talk to them and coach them to do the right thing like take the keys or put the care in another place.i tell families to stop being the caregiver and go back to being a family member and make me the  bad guy ' .<br />i do n't want to ride with you ' and that is a pretty strong message.it's important to work with families and ask them ,<br />why are you letting the most unable person in the room drive down the street ? '<br />it usually has to do with the way this family has made decisions in the past as well as cultural issues , and family dynamics .<br />when i brought up the situation to the family , they agreed and the patient stopped driving until his medical situation improved .<br />he 's doing a lot better now.the second largest category involved the use of therapeutic communication strategies ( n = 14 , 21% ) .<br />one participant stated  ask the older adult about how they feel about their ability to drive .<br />i show empathy toward him and his loss of independence and having to rely on family for transportation ,  and  i try to be honest about safety concerns.i used therapeutic communication .<br />i told him the concerns such as him not being able to recall the names of the roads that he just drove on to get here.i talked to her conversationally about how she 's been doing and how her family has been doing .<br />i started asking about driving when i asked her about her vision and eye glasses .<br />this made her feel comfortable first so then i asked about this [ the driving ] .<br />bring the family into it .<br />ultimately , they are the ones to take the keys if the patient is resistant .<br />sometimes i will voice safety concerns that have been brought up by the family .<br />if the family is present , i try to talk to them and coach them to do the right thing like take the keys or put the care in another place .<br />i tell families to stop being the caregiver and go back to being a family member and make me the  bad guy ' .<br />i do n't want to ride with you ' and that is a pretty strong message .<br />it 's important to work with families and ask them ,  why are you letting the most unable person in the room drive down the street ? '<br />it usually has to do with the way this family has made decisions in the past as well as cultural issues , and family dynamics .<br />when i brought up the situation to the family , they agreed and the patient stopped driving until his medical situation improved .<br />i show empathy toward him and his loss of independence and having to rely on family for transportation ,  and  i try to be honest about safety concerns .<br />i told him the concerns such as him not being able to recall the names of the roads that he just drove on to get here .<br />i talked to her conversationally about how she 's been doing and how her family has been doing .<br />i started asking about driving when i asked her about her vision and eye glasses .<br />this made her feel comfortable first so then i asked about this [ the driving ] .<br />a third largest category contained incidents that described incidents where the nurse practitioner referred the patient to occupational or physical therapy ( n = 10 , 15% ) , while 12% ( n = 8) involved conducting a vision screening examination .<br />eleven percent of the incidents ( n = 7 ) described using a step approach to driving termination .<br />first thing is to eliminate driving at night and then i try to find out what 's the most important thing they want to drive to .<br />i have one patient who only wants to drive 2 miles from his home to the gas station where he goes into buy his coffee and newspaper and then he drives home .<br />for the longest time<br />this is the only driving he would do and then came the day when i did n't feel he was safe to do that anymore<br />and we had him stop driving<br />i do n't think you can just take it all away from them unless it 's really imminent that they are going to hurt themselves.work with patient to drive only at certain times of the day and to certain areas that are familiar .<br />i had one patient who had very slow response times so we placed a restriction that he could only drive on certain roads and stay off main roads .<br />first thing is to eliminate driving at night and then i try to find out what 's the most important thing they want to drive to .<br />i have one patient who only wants to drive 2 miles from his home to the gas station where he goes into buy his coffee and newspaper and then he drives home .<br />for the longest time<br />this is the only driving he would do and then came the day when i did n't feel he was safe to do that anymore<br />and we had him stop driving<br />i do n't think you can just take it all away from them unless it 's really imminent that they are going to hurt themselves .<br />work with patient to drive only at certain times of the day and to certain areas that are familiar .<br />i had one patient who had very slow response times so we placed a restriction that he could only drive on certain roads and stay off main roads .<br />additional categories reflected the importance of using objective data when discussing driving safety with older adults ( n = 5 , 7% ) and referring the patient to the department of motor vehicles ( n = 3 , 5% ) .<br />two incidents ( 3% ) described referring the patient to a medical specialist , while one incident ( 2% ) described the importance of avoiding the use of inappropriate , high - risk medications with older adult drivers .<br />when participants ( nurse practitioners ) were asked to list perceived barriers for driving cessation , the most frequently mentioned barriers included resistance from the patient with denial , lack of alternative transportation , spousal denial , and increased isolation .<br />a listing of the most frequent barriers that nurse practitioners face in working with older adult drivers is presented in table 4 .<br />the participants in this study closely represent the national np demographics .<br />compared to the 2012 national aanp sample survey ,<br />the demographics of nps nationally were a mean age of 51 years , white ( 85.4% ) , black / african american ( 3% ) , female ( 9.4% ) , having a graduate level degree ( 97.2% ) , and having practiced as a np for 11 years .<br />this study identified strategies used by nps in the assessment and intervention of older adults in one geographical region .<br />obvious limitations of this study are the limitation to one geographical area .<br />to the author 's knowledge , this is one of the first studies to examine self - report behaviors and strategies of nps on this topic .<br />clinical practice for assessing and intervening with older adult drivers varies significantly from provider to provider .<br />nps are educated to practice holistically and place great importance on building rapport and trust with their patients and their families .<br />this trusting relationship will prove beneficial when a difficult conversation such as driving cessation is needed .<br />impaired cognition was the most common reason a np determined a need to intervene . assessing cognitive status , physical frailty , and sensory impairments were the most common physical exam strategies used .<br />obtaining collateral information from family members ranked just below obtaining physical exam or objective data .<br />using therapeutic communication techniques and a concern of safety for the older adult were the most common strategies used in approaching the older adult about driving .<br />nps ranked the most helpful intervention was to involve family members and the least helpful intervention was the lack of family guidance from the provider . dealing with patient concerns about lack of transportation , especially in rural areas , and resistance to driving termination were the two most common perceived barriers .<br />the wide variation in ways which nps make the determination to address driving in older adults and the lack of consistent guidelines for dealing with this issue should be noted .<br />as the supply of primary care physicians is expected to decrease , the number of nurse practitioners ( nps ) is expected to increase 94% between 2008 and 2025 .<br />nps are trained to provide a holistic approach to patient care and approximately half of all nps practice in the primary care setting .<br />standardized curriculum for nurse practitioner students does not require faculty to address concerns of older adult drivers ; therefore , few nps graduate with this training .<br />this could be due to lack of clinical guidelines , and faculty are unclear as to what should be taught .<br />as this is a public safety concern<br />having difficult conversations with older adults such as driving cessation is time consuming and possibly threatens the patient - provider relationship .<br />there is a need for the development of clinical guidelines that nps can use efficiently during a routine office visit .<br />nps feel comfortable using evidenced - based clinical guidelines to guide their clinical practice with common chronic disease management .<br />development of an evidenced - based clinical guideline for assessment and intervention with older adult drivers would be used similarly .<br />our social work and occupational therapist colleagues have been working on this issue for quite some time .<br />occupational therapists have developed guidelines for them to use in assessment of older adult drivers .<br />nps and np students should also be aware of community resources available in their areas of clinical practice .<br />simply making themselves aware of resources available to them and the older adult , such as the online aarp driver safety program that can be found at http://www.aarp.org/home-garden/transportation/driver_safety/   would prove beneficial .<br />this study shows the varied and inconsistent clinical practice of nps assessing and intervening with older adults drivers . who is to say that one strategy is better than the other ?<br />it is clear that nps value the relationship they have with their patients and they value the need to intervene when public safety is at risk .<br />development of evidenced - based clinical guidelines would prove beneficial for nps to use in clinical practice , as long as the guidelines were able to be used quickly and efficiently .", "summary": "<pad> objectives. to identify strategies utilized by nurse practitioners ( nps ) in the assessment and intervention of older adult drivers in southeastern north carolina. methods. critical incident interviews aimed at identifying specific behaviors and strategies used by nps when assessing and intervening with older adults drivers were conducted with a sample of 21 nps recruited through the north carolina nurses association council of nurse practitioners -

stage dementia .<br />there is a growing consensus about the need to measure qol in dementia trials , as such assessments allow researchers to evaluate the benefits and harms of a treatment and elements of health not detected by standard clinical outcomes .<br />however , it is very difficult to determine qol in persons with late - stage dementia as they can not communicate reliably and are not involved in activities widely accepted by others as rewarding .<br />due<br />the severity of cognitive impairment of patients with moderate to severe ad , assessment must rely on proxy reports or direct observation .<br />unfortunately , both of these approaches tend to exclude consideration of the patient s subjective experiences , which many believe to be an inherent feature of qol .<br />the quality of life in late - stage dementia ( qualid ) scale was originally developed by weiner and co - workers in 2000 .<br />the qualid is a late - stage , dementia - specific questionnaire with a one - week window of observation .<br />it provides information about the patient s quality of life through assessments made by proxy informants .<br />the scale consists of 11 items , comprising both positive and negative dimensions of concrete and observable mood and performance , thought to be indicative of qol in late - stage dementia .<br />the items are rated by frequency of occurrence on a five - step scale , and scores are summed to range from 11 ( best qol ) to 55 ( worst qol ) .<br />while the qualid scale has been shown to obtain reliable estimates of qol and validated in patients with severe dementia residing in long - term care facilities , little is known about the scale s responsiveness to change due to therapeutic intervention .<br />the objective of this study was to assess the responsiveness of the qualid scale to changes in bpsd due to a therapeutic intervention in a population of long - term care residents with moderate to severe ad .<br />as well , this study evaluated the relationship between the qualid scale and the severity of bpsd as determined by standard validated research scales .<br />patients with moderate to severe ad ( mini - mental state examination [ mmse ] score  15 ) and agitation / aggression ( neuropsychiatric inventory  nursing home version [ npi]-total score  10 , npi - agitation / aggression score  1 ) at two long - term care sites were recruited to enter a three - month , open - label trial of 10 mg bid memantine , which has been shown to have a beneficial effect on memory and behaviour in ad patients .<br />this study was approved by the sunnybrook health sciences centre research ethics board , and was conducted in compliance with all relevant federal guidelines .<br />assessments were conducted four times throughout the study : at baseline and months 1 , 2 , and 3 .<br />npi clinical global impression  caregiver ( cgi ) , and cohen -

one patients were enrolled in the study , with an average age of 85.83.7 years .<br />twenty - nine ( 94% ) were men .<br />the mean (  sd ) mmse score at baseline was 8.76.7 , reflecting moderate to severe cognitive impairment .<br />twenty - four patients ( 77.4% ) completed the study ; two died of causes unrelated to the memantine treatment , three discontinued due to increasing agitation , one for significant physical deterioration , and one for significantly increased somnolence . at baseline<br />, patients had a mean qualid score of 21.36.2 , with a range from 13 to 40 .<br />table 1 provides the results of changes in outcome measurements over the course of the trial .<br />there were statistically significant differences in scores for npi total ( f3,90 = 4.035 , p = .010 ) and its subscale items : agitation / aggression ( f3,90 = 3.721 , p = .014 ) , and irritability ( f3,90 = 3.899 , p = .011 ) ; and cmai total ( f3,90 = 6.301 , p = .001 ) and its subscale items : physical aggression ( f3,90 = 5.928 , p = .001 ) and verbal aggression ( f3,90 = 3.961 , p = .011 ) .<br />no significant improvements were found for qualid ( t = 0.278 , p = .783 ) , mmse ( t = 0.819 , p = .419 ) , or cgi ( f3,84 = 0.760 , p = .520 ) .<br />outcome measures at baseline and endpoint qualid scores were compared with scores on the npi , cmai , and cgi at baseline and endpoint ( table 2 ) .<br />at both baseline and endpoint ,<br />the qualid scale was correlated with npi total score ( baseline :  = 0.270 , p = .037 ; endpoint :  = 0.404 , p = .002 ) , npi depression ( baseline :  = 0.332 , p = .022 ; endpoint :  = 0.381 , p = .008 ) , npi irritability ( baseline :  = 0.288 , p = .034 ; endpoint :  = 0.346 , p = .011 ) , and cmai verbal aggression ( baseline :  = 0.349 , p = .009 ; endpoint :  = 0.294 , p = .028 ) .<br />the qualid was correlated with npi agitation / aggression only at endpoint (  = 0.414 , p = .002 ) , as was npi anxiety (  = 0.290 , p = .049 ) , npi hallucinations (  = 0.456 , p = .002 ) , npi disinhibition (  = 0.322 , p = .026 ) and cmai total (  = 0.277 , p = .032 ) .<br />kendall correlations between qualid and other measures correlations between change scores of qualid and other measures between baseline and endpoint<br />correlations were calculated between change scores for the qualid and npi total , npi subscales , cmai and cgi ( table 3 ) .<br />qualid change scores were correlated with change scores in npi apathy (  = 0.345 , p = .012 ) .<br />however , there were no significant correlations between qualid and cmai , cgi , npi total or any subscales that were correlated with qualid scores at either baseline or endpoint .<br />concurrent validity was tested by comparing changes scores in patients who improved ( n = 19 ) based on the npi and patients who did not .<br />a decrease in 4 points in baseline score<br />mean change in qualid was similar between groups ( t = 0.873 , p = .390 ) .<br />it has been suggested that treatments designed to alleviate bpsd may have beneficial effects for patients qol , as a strong relationship between bpsd and qol has been previously observed .<br />the significant relationship between the npi and cmai with the qualid scores at baseline and final assessment suggest that qol is associated with behavioural symptoms in moderate to severe ad .<br />this result supports conclusions drawn by previous studies examining the relationship between the qualid scale and bpsd at a single point in time ; however , changes in the qualid score from baseline to endpoint did not correlate with change scores on the npi , cmai or cgi .<br />this lack of relationship suggests that the qualid scale may not be responsive to changes in bpsd .<br />concurrent validity was also tested , by comparing qualid change scores in patients who improved based on the npi and patients who did not .<br />as the mean change in qualid scores was similar between both groups<br />, this once again suggests that the qualid may not be responsive to changes in bpsd .<br />a previous study looking at the responsiveness of the qualid scale to drug treatment found that the qualid was responsive to the changes in bpsd .<br />the discrepancy in this finding may be due to the difference in study length ( i.e. , 14 days in the previous study compared to three months in the current ) .<br />it is possible that any short - term benefits from decreased behavioural problems are washed out by deterioration in overall health status over the long term .<br />the population in the previous study included 31 late - stage dementia patients residing in long - term care facilities who were given either olanzapine or risperidone .<br />the patients had a mean baseline qualid of 30.94 and mean npi of 53.48 , both of which are higher than those of the current study and other papers that have studied the qualid scale .<br />this study design reflects a more realistic timeframe for a therapeutic intervention , and is comparable to many other studies using antipsychotics , with a drug that has been shown to improve behavioural symptoms in moderate to severe ad .<br />the population is similar to most other studies in terms of mean qualid and mmse scores , even though the npi scores were slightly higher than those previously shown .<br />therefore , this analysis presents an appropriate design for a study involving patients with moderate to severe alzheimer s disease residing in long -

term benefits from decreased behavioural problems are washed out by deterioration in overall health status over the long term .<br />the population in the previous study included 31 late - stage dementia patients residing in long - term care facilities who were given either olanzapine or risperidone .<br />the patients had a mean baseline qualid of 30.94 and mean npi of 53.48 , both of which are higher than those of the current study and other papers that have studied the qualid scale .<br />this study design reflects a more realistic timeframe for a therapeutic intervention , and is comparable to many other studies using antipsychotics , with a drug that has been shown to improve behavioural symptoms in moderate to severe ad .<br />the population is similar to most other studies in terms of mean qualid and mmse scores , even though the npi scores were slightly higher than those previously shown .<br />therefore , this analysis presents an appropriate design for a study involving patients with moderate to severe alzheimer s disease residing in long - term care facilities and , as a result , should provide more applicable conclusions regarding the responsiveness of the qualid scale to change when a therapeutic intervention is implemented .<br />it is also unclear whether family caregiver assessment of qol would differ from nurses assessments .<br />it is possible that results attained from the qualid scale are accurate , and that to make an impact in patients qol over the long term , larger changes in behaviour , cognition , and function are necessary .<br />another possibility is that the effects of memantine were not strong enough to elicit a change in qol in the long -

four patients ( 77.4% ) completed the study ; two died of causes unrelated to the memantine treatment , three discontinued due to increasing agitation , one for significant physical deterioration , and one for significantly increased somnolence . at baseline<br />, patients had a mean qualid score of 21.36.2 , with a range from 13 to 40 .<br />table 1 provides the results of changes in outcome measurements over the course of the trial .<br />there were statistically significant differences in scores for npi total ( f3,90 = 4.035 , p = .010 ) and its subscale items : agitation / aggression ( f3,90 = 3.721 , p = .014 ) , and irritability ( f3,90 = 3.899 , p = .011 ) ; and cmai total ( f3,90 = 6.301 , p = .001 ) and its subscale items : physical aggression ( f3,90 = 5.928 , p = .001 ) and verbal aggression ( f3,90 = 3.961 , p = .011 ) .<br />no significant improvements were found for qualid ( t = 0.278 , p = .783 ) , mmse ( t = 0.819 , p = .419 ) , or cgi ( f3,84 = 0.760 , p = .520 ) .<br />outcome measures at baseline and endpoint qualid scores were compared with scores on the npi , cmai , and cgi at baseline and endpoint ( table 2 ) .<br />at both baseline and endpoint ,<br />the qualid scale was correlated with npi total score ( baseline :  = 0.270 , p = .037 ; endpoint :  = 0.404 , p = .002 ) , npi depression ( baseline :  = 0.332 , p = .022 ; endpoint :  = 0.381 , p = .008 ) , npi irritability ( baseline :  = 0.288 , p = .034 ; endpoint :  = 0.346 , p = .011 ) , and cmai verbal aggression ( baseline :  = 0.349 , p = .009 ; endpoint :  = 0.294 , p = .028 ) .<br />the qualid was correlated with npi agitation / aggression only at endpoint (  = 0.414 , p = .002 ) , as was npi anxiety (  = 0.290 , p = .049 ) , npi hallucinations (  = 0.456 , p = .002 ) , npi disinhibition (  = 0.322 , p = .026 ) and cmai total (  = 0.277 , p = .032 ) .<br />kendall correlations between qualid and other measures correlations between change scores of qualid and other measures between baseline and endpoint<br />correlations were calculated between change scores for the qualid and npi total , npi subscales , cmai and cgi ( table 3 ) .<br />qualid change scores were correlated with change scores in npi apathy (  = 0.345 , p = .012 ) .<br />however , there were no significant correlations between qualid and cmai , cgi , npi total or any subscales that were correlated with qualid scores at either baseline or endpoint .<br />concurrent validity was tested by comparing changes scores in patients who improved ( n = 19 ) based on the npi and patients who did not .<br />a decrease in 4 points in baseline score<br />mean change in qualid was similar between groups ( t = 0.873 , p = .390 ) .<br />it has been suggested that treatments designed to alleviate bpsd may have beneficial effects for patients qol , as a strong relationship between bpsd and qol has been previously observed .<br />the significant relationship between the npi and cmai with the qualid scores at baseline and final assessment suggest that qol is associated with behavioural symptoms in moderate to severe ad .<br />this result supports conclusions drawn by previous studies examining the relationship between the qualid scale and bpsd at a single point in time ; however , changes in the qualid score from baseline to endpoint did not correlate with change scores on the npi , cmai or cgi .<br />this lack of relationship suggests that the qualid scale may not be responsive to changes in bpsd .<br />concurrent validity was also tested , by comparing qualid change scores in patients who improved based on the npi and patients who did not .<br />as the mean change in qualid scores was similar between both groups<br />, this once again suggests that the qualid may not be responsive to changes in bpsd .<br />a previous study looking at the responsiveness of the qualid scale to drug treatment found that the qualid was responsive to the changes in bpsd .<br />the discrepancy in this finding may be due to the difference in study length ( i.e. , 14 days in the previous study compared to three months in the current ) .<br />it is possible that any short - term benefits from decreased behavioural problems are washed out by deterioration in overall health status over the long term .<br />the population in the previous study included 31 late - stage dementia patients residing in long - term care facilities who were given either olanzapine or risperidone .<br />the patients had a mean baseline qualid of 30.94 and mean npi of 53.48 , both of which are higher than those of the current study and other papers that have studied the qualid scale .<br />this study design reflects a more realistic timeframe for a therapeutic intervention , and is comparable to many other studies using antipsychotics , with a drug that has been shown to improve behavioural symptoms in moderate to severe ad .<br />the population is similar to most other studies in terms of mean qualid and mmse scores , even though the npi scores were slightly higher than those previously shown .<br />therefore , this analysis presents an appropriate design for a study involving patients with moderate to severe alzheimer s disease residing in long - term care facilities and , as a result , should provide more applicable conclusions regarding the responsiveness of the qualid scale to change when a therapeutic intervention is implemented .<br />it is also unclear whether family caregiver assessment of qol would differ from nurses assessments .<br />it is possible that results attained from the qualid scale are accurate , and that to make an impact in patients qol over the long term , larger changes in behaviour , cognition , and function are necessary .<br />another possibility is that the effects of memantine were not strong enough to elicit a change in qol in the long - term , despite significant improvements in behaviour rating scales .<br />another limitation is the fact that the majority of the patients in this study were male , and therefore the results may not necessarily be applicable to the general population of institutionalized patients with dementia .<br />however , gender does not appear to have a significant effect on quality of life in those with dementia .<br />while one study did find that being female was a significant predictor of lower quality of life as measured by the qualid , there was no difference between males and females in actual qualid scores , and the authors did not consider the results robust .<br />it is also unclear whether family caregiver assessment of qol would differ from nurses assessments .<br />it is possible that results attained from the qualid scale are accurate , and that to make an impact in patients qol over the long term , larger changes in behaviour , cognition , and function are necessary .<br />another possibility is that the effects of memantine were not strong enough to elicit a change in qol in the long -

population ratio of 1:1218 ( minimum recommended by the who being 1:1000 ) is struggling to cope with the health - care needs of a growing population .<br />people rely on alternative health - care professionals such as chemists , traditional medicine practitioners , and faith healers directly to meet their health needs and to reduce personal costs .<br />hence , pharmacists are one of the crucial focal points for health care in the community .<br />they have a large outreach to the public as the number of people visiting pharmacy outlets is possibly greater than other health - care units .<br />this although provides pharmacists with an opportunity for greater involvement in the health - care system , their fragmentary knowledge and improper dispensing practices may have undesired effects .<br />indiscriminate dispensing of antibiotics , sub - therapeutic quantities of antibacterials , inappropriate combination of drugs , and injectables under suboptimal conditions have also been reported in the previous studies .<br />hence , this study was undertaken to evaluate the drug dispensing practices at pharmacies and the knowledge of pharmacists in bengaluru .<br />the most important finding in this study was a high proportion ( 45% ) of dispensing encounters without prescription .<br />this dispensing pattern is similar to another study conducted in tamil nadu , india , where 58% of the pharmacists dispensed drugs without prescription but better than practices in other countries such as egypt ( 72% ) , tanzania ( 77% ) , and vietnam ( 99% ) where higher rates of dispensing without prescriptions were documented .<br />while lack of universal access to health care could be a major factor , convenience , reduced time to procure medicines , and cost consumption<br />furthermore , a higher proportion of dispensing encounters without prescription in the residential areas was observed as compared to the commercial areas .<br />apart from the reasons cited above , this could be due to a farther location of health - care facilities .<br />analgesics , antipyretics , antacids , cold and cough remedies , vitamins , nutrition supplements , and antibiotics constituted commonly dispensed drugs without prescription , in that order .<br />similar patterns were also seen in the egypt and tanzania studies while in the vietnam study and another study conducted in india , antibiotics , vitamins , and nutrition supplements were most commonly dispensed .<br />in another study conducted in saudi arabia , almost all the pharmacists dispensed antibiotics without prescription .<br />analgesics and antipyretics are the most commonly used drugs for relief of fever , common aches , and pains .<br />although aspirin and paracetamol can be dispensed without prescription , they can lead to adverse outcomes under certain conditions and hence , there is a need for them to be dispensed at right doses with proper counseling of end users .<br />other analgesics such as ibuprofen and diclofenac are prescription drugs .<br />while antacids are among over - the - counter ( otc ) drugs , most of the cold and cough remedies and all the antibiotics are schedule h drugs .<br />some authors have also questioned the appropriateness of widespread use of cold and cough remedies , some vitamin preparations and their irrational combinations .<br />this scenario prevails even in the face of existing regulations as most pharmacies do not adhere to them .<br />with bias<br />being a known caveat of questionnaire surveys the actual situation could still be worse .<br />in the uk ,<br />a prescription is valid for 6 months from the date of prescription , unless the medicine prescribed contains a controlled drug , in which case it is valid antibiotics and other drugs as otc medications .<br />under the federal law ,<br />prescriptions for schedule iii substances expire after 6 months and 5 refills are allowed within the 6-month period , whereas prescriptions for schedule ii controlled substances can not be refilled . in this study<br />, it was found that 77% of the pharmacists dispensed drugs for older prescriptions also .<br />this could be due to no specific regulations in place regarding duration of validity of a prescription in our country .<br />although antibiotics are an essential tool for modern medicine in combating most of the infections , antibiotic resistance remains to be a worldwide problem .<br />while misuse of antibiotics is a key factor contributing to antibiotic resistance , failure to take an antibiotic as prescribed adds no less .<br />only one - third of the pharmacists insisted on dispensing full course of the antibiotics prescribed and this improper dispensing can contribute to the growing health hazard of antibiotic resistance , which adds to health - care costs and<br />the gpp guidelines by the indian pharmaceutical association require the pharmacist , on receiving the prescription , to confirm the identity of the client , review the prescription for completeness , and check for correctness of the prescribed medications .<br />this is to ensure right dispensing and thus avoid contributing to medication errors at large , the stakes of which are high .<br />however , in this study , 81% of the pharmacists said they would not check for all the particulars .<br />, all of them did check for expiry of the medications before dispensing .<br />maintaining an inventory , especially a computerized one ,<br />in this study , we found that 41% of the pharmacies had a computerized inventory , 57% had manual inventory , and 2% did not maintain one .<br />according to the gpp guidelines pharmacies should preferably be equipped with computers for inventory management .<br />herbal medicines have emerged as a common choice of therapy for self - care as they are perceived to be free of side effects .<br />this practice is also enforced by irrational claims and aggressive promotions by manufacturers and media , peer views , and lack of well - documented unbiased studies on herbal drug use in disease conditions .<br />a study conducted in lagos , nigeria , showed that community pharmacies frequently supplied herbal medicines .<br />fifty - seven percent of the pharmacies included in this study also dispensed herbal medicines . in the uk ,<br />human medicines regulations 2012 allows only long - established and quality - controlled herbal medicines to be sold .<br />it has also implemented the traditional herbal medicines registration scheme for authorizing the marketing of herbal products .<br />medication counseling is the duty of the modern community pharmacists through which they can significantly contribute to medication safety and patient compliance .<br />the gpp guidelines require the pharmacist to provide professional counseling with regard to the use of medicines , their side effects , and precautions , if any . recognizing the importance of medication counseling , the north carolina board of pharmacy since 1993 made a rule to offer patient counseling on all new prescriptions .<br />however , a low rate of voluntary medication counseling by the pharmacists was noted in this study .<br />this could possibly be improved by modifying the attitude of pharmacists through educational interventions , incentives , and regulations .<br />drug storage practices , essential for maintaining efficacy of some drugs , were not in accordance with the gpp guidelines which states that pharmacies should be equipped with refrigerated storage facilities validated from time to time for products requiring storage at cold temperature .<br />also having a refrigerator in the pharmacy is a licensing requirement .<br />about 3% of the pharmacies did not have a refrigerator and about 31% of the pharmacies which had a refrigerator did not have power back - up for the same .<br />this scenario is better than another study conducted in pakistan where the majority of the pharmacies did not have an alternative power supply for the refrigerator .<br />generic substitution is the mutual substitution of medicinal products having the same active ingredient , in the same dose and pharmaceutical form .<br />this concept especially becomes important in case of biologicals and drugs with narrow therapeutic index .<br />disasters such as breakthrough seizures in epileptics due to disregard to the concept of generic substitution are well known .<br />nevertheless , unaware of its implications , 56% said they would dispense an alternative brand of the same drug in case of nonavailability of the brand prescribed , irrespective of which drug it was .<br />although guidelines for the same are in place in few countries , lack of such robust system in our country and unawareness can compound the problems faced in therapeutics .<br />indian pharmaceutical industry is now the third - largest in the world with more than 20,000 registered units .<br />the potential for error due to confusing names among health - care personnel has also significantly increased .<br />pharmacists should , therefore , be cautious while dispensing such drugs and take steps to avoid dispensing errors such as sticking warning labels and avoid keeping lasa drugs in close proximity .<br />however<br />, in this study , the majority ( 88% ) did not know about lasa drugs .<br />in all the pharmacies drugs<br />rampant use of antibiotics and other drugs as otc medications can lead to serious adverse drug reactions and antibiotic resistance .<br />hence , schedule h and schedule x of the drugs and cosmetic rules , 1945 , came into being .<br />schedule h includes substances that could be sold by retail on the prescription of a registered medical practitioner only .<br />schedule x drugs are those for which a retailer has to preserve the prescription for a period of 2 years .<br />while schedule x has worked , schedule h implementation has been lax , necessitating the schedule h1 , with 46 drugs in its purview .<br />schedule h1 came into effect from march 1 , 2014 , and contains prescription only drugs for which a copy of the prescription has to be preserved .<br />only about half of the pharmacists were aware of schedule h and 17.5% were updated with current regulations on schedule h1 .<br />sixty - five percent of the pharmacists are not aware that prescription in duplicate and stringent dispensing records have to be maintained while dispensing schedule x drugs .<br />knowledge and updated drug information is a must for people involved in drug dispensing to assure the quality of dispensing .<br />however , most of them obtain their drug information in informal ways such as industry representatives and peers .<br />thus , given the gap in knowledge of pharmacists and their unawareness of current regulations , their dispensing practices may undo the beneficial effects of the health - care system .<br />however , a drug dispensing audit at pharmacies could have avoided the bias associated with a questionnaire - based study .<br />furthermore , simple random sampling instead of convenient sampling could have been more representative of all pharmacies in bengaluru city .<br />this study revealed improper dispensing practices at pharmacies in both residential and commercial areas of bengaluru city with a high proportion of dispensing encounters without prescription , a higher rate of older prescription refills and inadequate medication counseling , and storage practices .<br />it also highlights lacunae in the knowledge of pharmacists about schedule h and current regulations pertaining to scheduled drugs .<br />a similar scenario seems to prevail elsewhere in india and in other developing countries of the world .<br />hence , structured educational campaigns , generation , and implementation of otc list , and regulatory enforcement can better equip pharmacists for their main role of promoting rational drug use .", "summary": "objectives : to assess the drug dispensing practices and knowledge of pharmacists in bengaluru city.materials and methods : a cross -
